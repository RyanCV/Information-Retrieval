ku chancellor report the university of kansas see how simple solutions built a business microscopic management ku diabetes researchers invent new lab technique then spin off a biotech firm health care technology is a complex field but ku medical center s lisa stehno bittel has learned not to overlook what is small or simple stehno bittel professor of physical therapy and rehabilitation science and one of the world s leading diabetes researchers focuses on islets cells that produce insulin in the pancreas while working on islet transplant experiments her lab manager janette williams pointed out something something simple they hadn t noticed before smaller islets behaved differently than larger islets the small islets were more robust and produced more insulin than larger islets and when they transplanted only small islets into diabetic rats the rats were cured if they transplanted only large islets the rats were never cured but this breakthrough presented another problem how to reengineer the large islets to make them function like small ones they couldn t just throw away healthy tissue they investigated complex solutions for five years until karthik ramachandran then a ku bioengineering doctoral student invented a simple answer lisa stehno bittel is professor and department chair of physical therapy and rehabilitation science in the school of health professions she co founded likarda llc with former bioengineering doctoral student karthik ramachandran ramachandran made a micromold a small plate of glass with microscopic divots he took the large islets down to their simple cells and loaded those into the micromold the cells fell into the microscopic divots found each other combined and grew three dimensionally into cell clusters the clusters became new small islets and began producing insulin when the new lab grown small islets were injected into diabetic rats the rats were cured the researchers named their new islet the kanslet the micromold was the basis of ramachandran s doctoral dissertation and after he and stehno bittel presented their findings at a national islet meeting scientists from a major pharmaceutical company approached them they wanted to use their technique and the micromold s ability to grow almost any type of cell clusters to screen new drugs after a few months stehno bittel and ramachandran licensed their patents from ku and cofounded a new biotech company likarda llc likarda is now creating diabetes treatments for pets providing technology to screen drugs for cancer cures and after only three years is no longer a startup company but a profitable and growing small business as stehno bittel says simple can be successful karthik ramachandran and lisa stehno bittel work with a likarda lab technician the next time you put out an idea and somebody says oh that will never work it s too simple i want you to stop and tell them the story of the kanslet lisa stehno bittel likarda llc is a biotech startup company at the bioscience technology business center at ku medical center it has developed a micromold to create cell clusters that can be used to screen new drugs or treat diseases contact us contact the university of kansas chancellor ku edu office of the chancellor strong hall jayhawk blvd room lawrence ks academics admissions alumni athletics campuses contacts giving jobs maps contact ku lawrence ks maps the university of kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race color ethnicity religion sex national origin age ancestry disability status as a veteran sexual orientation marital status parental status gender identity gender expression and genetic information in the university s programs and activities retaliation is also prohibited by university policy the following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policies and are the title ix coordinators for their respective campuses executive director of the office of institutional opportunity access ioa ku edu west campus road room a lawrence ks tty for the lawrence edwards parsons yoder and topeka campuses director equal opportunity office mail stop shawnee mission parkway fairway ks tty for the wichita salina and kansas city kansas medical center campuses
