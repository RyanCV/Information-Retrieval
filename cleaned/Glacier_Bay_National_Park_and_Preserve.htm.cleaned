states national park and preserve in the alaska panhandle west of juneau president calvin coolidge proclaimed the area around glacier bay a national monument under the antiquities act on february subsequent to an expansion of the monument by president jimmy carter in the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca enlarged the national monument by acres km on december and in the process created glacier bay national park and preserve with additional acres km of public land designated as national preserve to the immediate northwest of the park in order to protect a portion of the alsek river and related fish and wildlife habitats while allowing sport hunting glacier bay became part of a binational unesco world heritage site in was inscribed as a biosphere reserve in and in

section of the southeastern alaska coastline between the gulf of alaska and canada the canadian border approaches to within miles km of the ocean in the st elias mountains at mount fairweather the park s tallest peak at feet m transitioning to the fairweather range from there southwards the brady icefield caps the fairweather range on a peninsula extending from the ocean to glacier bay which extends from icy strait to the canadian border at grand pacific glacier cutting off the western part of the park to the east of glacier bay the takhinsha mountains and the chilkat range form a peninsula bounded by the lynn canal on the east with the park s eastern boundary with tongass national forest running along the ridgeline the park s northwestern boundary which also abuts tongass national forest runs in the valley of the alsek river to dry bay the preserve lands comprise a small area at dry bay the majority of glacier bay lands are national park lands the park boundary excludes gustavus at the mouth of glacier bay the lands adjoining the park to the north in canada are included in tatshenshini alsek provincial park no roads lead to the park and it is most easily reached by air travel during some summers there are ferries to the small community of gustavus or directly to the marina at bartlett cove despite the lack of roads there are over visitors each year most of whom arrive via cruise ship the number of ships that may arrive each day is limited by regulation other travelers come on white water rafting trips putting in on the tatshenshini river at dalton post in the yukon territory and taking out at the dry bay ranger station in the glacier bay national preserve trips generally take six days and pass through kluane national park and reserve in

marine ecosystems can be compared within the park and preserve there are two tlingit ancestral homelands that are of cultural and spiritual significance to living communities today the alsek river serves as a route of discovery and migration from the coastal mountain range in the park to the pacific ocean in the preserve within the preserve in contrast to the park the alsek river provides a setting for subsistence uses commercial fishing and hunting as provided for in the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca while simultaneously protecting the glacial ecosytem there are fifteen tidewater glaciers in the park glaciers descending from high snow capped mountains into the bay create spectacular displays of ice and iceberg formation in the last century the most dramatic was probably the muir glacier the calving face was nearly miles km wide and about feet m high glacier bay national park and preserve includes nine tidewater glaciers four of these glaciers actively calve icebergs into the bay in the s the muir glacier receded to the point that it was no longer a tidewater glacier most visitors today travel to the margerie and lamplugh glaciers the advance and recession of the park s glaciers has been extensively documented since la perouse visited the bay in in general the glaciers of the fairweather range are advancing and the chilkat range glaciers are receding the region is being lifted by tectonic activity with frequent earthquakes earthquake induced landslides have been significant forces for change inducing tsunamis that are believed to have reached feet m in height regions of the park closest to the gulf of alaska have a relatively mild climate with significant rainfall and comparatively low snowfall lower glacier bay is a transitional zone and upper glacier bay is cold and snowy access to the land can be difficult since the glacial fjords have steep walls that rise directly from the water where there are shoreline flats they can be densely vegetated with alder and devils club making hiking difficult ecosystems in the park are wet tundra alpine tundra coastal forest and glaciers and icefields wildlife in the area includes both grizzly and black bears coyotes moose sitka black tailed deer marmots dall sheep canadian lynxes cougars sea otters harbor seals steller sea lions pacific white sided dolphins orcas minke whales humpback whale bald eagles gulls waterfowl and salmon glacial retreat edit joseph whidbey master of the discovery during the vancouver expedition found icy strait at the south end of glacier bay choked with ice in glacier bay itself was almost entirely covered by one large tidewater glacier in naturalist john muir found that the ice had retreated almost all the way up the bay a distance of around miles km by the grand pacific glacier was at the head of tarr inlet about miles km from glacier bay s mouth this is the fastest documented glacier retreat not all of the park s glaciers are in retreat two examples are the johns hopkins glacier which according to observations in has been advancing at the rate of ft m to ft m per day and the margerie glacier which is stable neither advancing nor retreating scientists working in the park and preserve hope to learn how glacial activity relates to climate change activities edit margerie glacier from nps tour boat about of visitors to glacier bay arrive on cruise ships the national park service operates cooperative programs where rangers provide interpretive services aboard the ships and on the smaller boats that offer excursion trips to more distant park features in park accommodations are available at the glacier park lodge the park and preserve hosts many outdoor activities such as hiking camping mountaineering kayaking rafting fishing and bird watching unlike many other national parks in alaska subsistence hunting is not allowed in the park only in the preserve sport hunting and trapping are also allowed in the preserve to hunt and trap you must have all required licenses and permits and follow all other state regulations the national park service and the state of alaska cooperatively manage the wildlife resources of the preserve campers and hunters should be aware that brown bears are common in the preserve and be prepared to avoid conflicts with them typically hunted species in the preserve include black bears mountain goats wolves wolverines snowshoe hare ptarmigans waterfowls and a number of furbearers there is one big game hunting guide authorized through concession contracts to operate within glacier bay national preserve three lodges and one outfitter can provide transportation and services for fishing and hunting small game and waterfowl sport fishing is another activity popular in the park halibut are frequently esteemed by deep sea fishers and in rivers and lakes dolly varden and rainbow trout provide sport an alaskan sportfishing license is required for all nonresidents and older and residents to fish in alaska s fresh and salt waters history edit prehistory and exploration edit several glaciers and a pool of meltwater the earliest traces of human occupation at glacier bay date to about years before the present with archaeological sites just outside the park dating to that time evidence of human activity is scarce because so much of the area is or was glaciated for much of the period and because advancing glaciers may have scoured all traces of historical occupation from their valleys ongoing uplift of the land may reveal new sites that had been submerged by rising sea levels most archaeological evidence is from the last years the haida eyak and tlingit all could have occupied the coast until historical times when the tlingit came to dominate the area jean françois de galaup comte de lapérouse was the first european to explore the alaskan coast in the region of glacier bay in arriving in lituya bay and making contact with the tlingit a russian ship visited in claiming the region for russia the region was later visited by george vancouver in discovery in during his during the vancouver expedition the explorers are believed to have seen the glacier bay ice at its peak which coincided with their visits russians were chiefly concerned with the area until the s when americans were drawn to alaska and the klondike by the klondike gold rush of the s a cannery was established in dundas bay in and the first tourist ships arrived in john muir visited glacier bay in just prior to the establishment of yosemite national park muir s first great cause muir came to alaska to learn about glaciers as a means of understanding the formation of the glaciated landscape of the yosemite valley muir sent dispatches back to san francisco to be published in the san francisco bulletin in both and eventually collecting these stories accounts of his third and fourth trips in and and later lectures and articles into the book travels in alaska promoting glacier bay and the inside passage muir s writings led to the naming of muir glacier then nearly feet m tall at tidewater and the most active glacier in the bay after muir the pacific coast steamship company ran tours up the inside passage from tacoma and portland during the s highlighting muir glacier and glacier bay the accessibility of glacier bay brought naturalists and geologists to study survey and name the glaciers the harriman alaska expedition of was organized by railroad executive edward harriman who recruited muir george bird grinnell photographer edward s curtis and several others to study the alaska coast on a specially outfitted ship spending five days at glacier bay the expedition noted significant glacial retreat a few months later the magnitude earthquake that shook yakutat bay on september caused muir glacier to collapse into the bay filling it and making it less attractive to tourists and after taku glacier became a popular destination in a salmon cannery was established at dundas bay operating until muir s writings attracted the attention of william skinner cooper an ecologist at the university of minnesota who saw the bay s retreating glaciers as an opportunity to study plant succession on the recently exposed land he visited glacier bay in surveying the glaciers and inlets and establishing nine test plots to be monitored in future visits cooper returned to glacier bay in wrote a paper for the ecological society of america in which he proposed that glacier bay be protected as a national monument the ecological society established a committee to promote the designation of glacier bay as a national monument at the urging of cooper forwarding copies of their resolutions to president calvin coolidge the national park service the smithsonian and the governor of alaska the idea was opposed by the u s geological survey which reported that the area had potential for mineral extraction the interior department decided to send an agent to survey the area assigning george alexander parks of the general land office and a future governor of alaska to examine the area and to canvass local residents parks report recommended a very limited boundary designed to include glaciers and little else in response cooper and the ecological society undertook a letter writing campaign that supported the park service and caused coolidge to add some portions of mature forest to the park s boundaries coolidge s proclamation under the antiquities act of glacier bay national monument came on february national monument edit alaska game managers came under heavy criticism in the s for a perceived lack of interest in protecting alaskan brown bears the state approached the park service with a proposal to expand the boundaries of the glacier bay monument using land from tongass national forest as a bear sanctuary park service studies were favorable and the forest service came to view an expansion of glacier bay as preferable to the designation of admiralty island as a national park which was first proposed in the s by the late s ernest gruening the director of the department of territories and island possessions and future governor of alaska suggested that the entire region be protected in a single unit extending up the saint elias range to the wrangell range the substance of gruening s idea would not be realized until when wrangell st elias national monument would be proclaimed in the meantime the wrangell st elias proposal was set aside in favor of expansions to the east for bear habitat and to the west to protect the gulf of alaska coastline president franklin d roosevelt used the antiquities act to expand the monument on april creating the largest unit in the national park system at the time during world war ii the u s army appropriated an area around excursion inlet to be used as a logistics base for transferring materiel from barges transiting the inside passage to seagoing vessels logging the area for pilings to be used in piers the base was never used at the same time the army built an airfield at gustavus which offered flat terrain and good weather the airfield was completed too late to participate in the aleutian campaign however it was one of four alaskan airfields suitable for use by b s with foot m and foot m runways and modern navigation equipment in the area around gustavus was removed from the monument and returned to the public domain together with acres ha at excursion inlet no park service personnel were assigned to the monument until when a seasonal ranger was stationed at bartlett cove the monument was administered locally from onwards starting in the facilities at bartlett cove were expanded as part of the park service s mission program with employee housing and maintenance facilities an administrative site was also developed outside the monument boundaries at the forest service ranger station at indian point on auke bay closer to juneau the glacier bay lodge was built to accommodate guests in beginning in cruise ships became regular visitors to the monument brady icefield in survey crews found a rich deposit of copper and nickel ore under the brady icefield investigators looked at a nunatak outcrop in the icefield and found highly mineralized rock newmont exploration ltd proposed the construction of a mile km adit to an underground mine under the icefield with a mill at the portal opening and a road to piers at dixon bay this proposal took advantage of legislation that permitted mineral exploitation in the monument which had been confined to small prospectors until this time in response to this and other proposals montana senator lee metcalf proposed the mining in the parks act to resolve and eventually prohibit mining at glacier bay and five other parks and monuments however the final bill contained a number of significant exemptions and the newmont claim has never been resolved although no mining activity has been proposed since the s national park and preserve edit as a result of the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa acres ha of alaskan public lands were eligible for inclusion in the national park system studies for expansion of glacier bay focused on the area around the alsek river facing an approaching deadline imposed by ancsa to resolve land allotment and seeing delays in the proposed alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca in congress that was intended to make a final settlement president jimmy carter used his authority under the antiquities act to proclaim fifteen national park service units in alaska on december the proclamation also expanded glacier bay national monument to include the alsek lands the final anilca legislation signed into law by carter on december established glacier bay national park and preserve from the national monument the alsek addition comprised the bulk of the preserve lands the chief distinction between park and preserve lands is that sport hunting by non residents is permitted in accordance with alaskan game regulations in the preserve but prohibited in the park world heritage site edit the kluane wrangell st elias glacier bay
