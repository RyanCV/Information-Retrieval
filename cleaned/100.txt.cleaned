experiencing a self reported good day by over half although the amount of sleep each person needs varies some most people require between seven and eight hours of sleep each night the following are some suggestions for helping with good sleep have a routine as much as possible get up at the approximately the same time and go to bed at the same time each night on week ends try to stick within an hour of your week day schedule sleep only when you are tired if you have not fallen asleep within twenty minutes of getting into bed get up and find something else to do read talk to a friend etc
