despite its name is not a canyon but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the paunsaugunt plateau bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks the red orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors bryce sits at a much higher elevation than nearby zion national park the rim at bryce varies from to feet to m the bryce canyon area was settled by mormon pioneers in the s and was named after ebenezer bryce who homesteaded in the area in the area around bryce canyon became a national monument in and was designated as a national park in the park covers acres sq mi ha km and receives relatively few visitors compared to zion national park and the grand canyon largely due to its remote location contents geography and climate history native american habitation european american exploration and settlement creation of the park more recent history geology biology activities notes references further reading external links geography and climate edit bryce canyon national park is located in southwestern utah about miles km northeast of and feet m higher than zion national park the weather in bryce canyon is therefore cooler and the park receives more precipitation a total of to inches to mm per year yearly temperatures vary from an average minimum of f c in january to an average maximum of f c in july but extreme temperatures can range from to f to c the record high temperature in the park was f c on july the record low temperature was f c on december the national park lies within the colorado plateau geographic province of north america and straddles the southeastern edge of the paunsaugunt plateau west of the paunsaugunt fault paunsaugunt is paiute for home of the beaver park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau s edge toward a valley containing the fault and the paria river just beyond it paria is paiute for muddy or elk water the edge of the kaiparowits plateau bounds the opposite side of the valley bryce canyon was not formed from erosion initiated from a central stream meaning it technically is not a canyon instead headward erosion has excavated large amphitheater shaped features in the cenozoic aged rocks of the paunsaugunt plateau this erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called hoodoos that are up to feet m high a series of amphitheaters extends more than miles km north to south within the park the largest is bryce amphitheater which is miles km long miles km wide and feet m deep a nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the same formation but at a higher elevation is in cedar breaks national monument which is miles km to the west on the markagunt plateau rainbow point the highest part of the park at feet m is at the end of the mile km scenic drive from there aquarius plateau bryce amphitheater the

habitation edit little is known about early human habitation in the bryce canyon area archaeological surveys of bryce canyon national park and the paunsaugunt plateau show that people have been in the area for at least years basketmaker anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park other artifacts from the pueblo period anasazi and the fremont culture up to the mid th century have also been found the paiute indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left these native americans hunted and gathered for most of their food but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products the paiute in the area developed a mythology surrounding the hoodoos pinnacles in bryce canyon they believed that hoodoos were the legend people whom the trickster coyote turned to stone at least one older paiute said his culture called the hoodoos anka ku was a wits which is paiute for red painted faces european american exploration and settlement edit it was not until the late th and the early th century that the first european americans explored the remote and hard to reach area mormon scouts visited the area in the s to gauge its potential for agricultural development use for grazing and settlement ebenezer bryce and his family lived in bryce canyon in this cabin here photographed c the first major scientific expedition to the area was led by u s army major john wesley powell in powell along with a team of mapmakers and geologists surveyed the sevier and virgin river area as part of a larger survey of the colorado plateaus his mapmakers kept many of the paiute place names small groups of mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of bryce canyon along the paria river in the kanarra cattle company started to use the area for cattle grazing the church of jesus christ of latter day saints sent scottish immigrant ebenezer bryce and his wife mary to settle land in the paria valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area the bryce family chose to live right below bryce canyon amphitheater bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a helluva place to lose a cow he also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber and a canal to irrigate his crops and water his animals other settlers soon started to call the unusual place bryce s canyon which was later formalized into bryce canyon a combination of drought overgrazing and flooding eventually drove the remaining paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the sevier river drainage when that effort failed most of the settlers including the bryce family left the area bryce moved his family to arizona in the remaining settlers dug a mile km ditch from the sevier s east fork into tropic valley creation of the park edit bryce canyon lodge was built between and from local materials these scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles published by union pacific and santa fe railroads in people like forest supervisor j w humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of bryce canyon s amphitheaters and by nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest however poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum ruby syrett harold bowman and the perry brothers later built modest lodging and set up touring services in the area syrett later served as the first postmaster of bryce canyon visitation steadily increased and by the early s the union pacific railroad became interested in expanding rail service into southwestern utah to accommodate more tourists in the area became a national park it now has this visitors center at the same time conservationists became alarmed by the damage overgrazing logging and unregulated visitation were having on the fragile features of bryce canyon a movement to have the area protected was soon started and national park service director stephen mather responded by proposing that bryce canyon be made into a state park the governor of utah and the utah state legislature however lobbied for national protection of the area mather relented and sent his recommendation to president warren g harding who on june declared bryce canyon a national monument a road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters from to bryce canyon lodge was built from local timber and stone members of the united states congress started work in on upgrading bryce canyon s protection status from a u s national monument to a national park in order to establish utah national park a process led by the utah parks company for transferring ownership of private and state held land in the monument to the federal government started in the last of the land in the proposed park s borders was sold to the federal government four years later and on february the renamed bryce canyon national park was established in president herbert hoover annexed an adjoining area south of the park and in an additional acres ha was added this brought the park s total area to the current figure of acres ha rim road the scenic drive that is still used today was completed in by the civilian conservation corps administration of the park was conducted from neighboring zion national park until when bryce canyon s first superintendent started work more recent history edit the uss bryce canyon was named for the park and served as a supply and repair ship in the u s pacific fleet from september to june bryce canyon natural history association bcnha was established in it runs the bookstore inside the park visitor center and is a non profit organization created to aid the interpretive educational and scientific activities of the national park service at bryce canyon national park a portion of the profits from all bookstore sales are donated to public land units responding to increased visitation and traffic congestion the national park service implemented a voluntary summer only in park shuttle system in june in reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in the park geology edit main article geology of the bryce canyon area erosion of sedimentary rocks has created natural arches thor s hammer the bryce canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the cretaceous period and the first half of the cenozoic era the ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now the park varied the dakota sandstone and the tropic shale were deposited in the warm shallow waters of the advancing and retreating cretaceous seaway outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders the colorful claron formation from which the park s delicate hoodoos are carved was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from to about million years ago from the paleocene to the eocene epochs different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and river deltas migrated several other formations were also created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift the laramide orogeny affected the entire western part of what would become north america starting about million to million years ago this event helped to build the rocky mountains and in the process closed the cretaceous seaway the straight cliffs wahweap and kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift the colorado plateaus were uplifted million years ago and were segmented into different plateaus each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate the boat mesa conglomerate and the sevier river formation were removed by erosion following this uplift this uplift created vertical joints which over time were preferentially eroded the easily eroded pink cliffs of the claron formation responded by forming freestanding pinnacles in badlands called hoodoos while the more resistant white cliffs formed monoliths the brown pink and red colors are from hematite iron oxide fe o the yellows from limonite feo oh n h o and the purples are from pyrolusite mno also created were arches natural bridges walls and windows hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements bryce canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on earth the formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the grand staircase the oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the grand canyon the intermediate ones in zion national park and its youngest parts are laid bare in bryce canyon area a small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park biology edit mule deer are the most common large animals found in the park more than native plant species live in the park there are three life zones in the park based on elevation the lowest areas of the park are dominated by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita serviceberry and antelope bitterbrush in between aspen cottonwood water birch and willow grow along streams ponderosa pine forests cover the mid elevations with blue spruce and douglas fir in water rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush douglas fir and white fir along with aspen and engelmann spruce make up the forests on the paunsaugunt plateau the harshest areas have limber pine and ancient great basin bristlecone pine some more than years old holding on bryce canyon has extensive fir forests the forests and meadows of bryce canyon provide the habitat to support diverse animal life from birds and small mammals to foxes and occasional bobcats cougars and black bears mule deer are the most common large mammals in the park elk and pronghorn which have been reintroduced nearby sometimes venture into the park bryce canyon national park forms part of the habitat of three wildlife species that are listed under the endangered species act the utah prairie dog the california condor and the southwestern willow flycatcher the utah prairie dog is a threatened species that was reintroduced to the park for conservation and the largest protected population is found within the park s boundaries about species of birds visit the park each year including swifts and swallows most species migrate to warmer regions in winter although jays ravens nuthatches eagles and owls stay in winter the mule deer mountain lion and coyotes migrate to lower elevations ground squirrels and marmots pass the winter in hibernation eleven species of reptiles and four species of amphibians have been found at in the park reptiles include the great basin rattlesnake short horned lizard side blotched lizard striped whipsnake and the tiger salamander also in the park are the black lumpy very slow growing colonies of cryptobiotic soil which are a mix of lichens algae fungi and cyanobacteria together these organisms slow erosion add nitrogen to soil and help it to retain moisture activities edit there are marked trails for hiking for which snowshoes are required in winter navajo trail trees are douglas fir and ponderosa pine most park visitors sightsee using the scenic drive which provides access to viewpoints over the amphitheaters bryce canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day round trip time trailhead mossy cave one hour state route northwest of tropic rim trail hours anywhere on rim bristlecone loop one hour rainbow point and queens garden hours sunrise point are easy to moderate hikes navajo loop hours sunset point and tower bridge hours north of sunrise point are moderate hikes fairyland loop hours fairyland point and peekaboo loop hours bryce point are strenuous hikes several of these trails intersect allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes the park also has two trails designated for overnight hiking the mile km riggs spring loop trail and the mile km under the rim trail both require a backcountry camping permit in total there are miles km of trails in the park horse riding is available in the park from april through october more than miles km of marked but ungroomed skiing trails are available off of fairyland paria and rim trails in the park twenty miles km of connecting groomed ski trails are in nearby dixie national forest and ruby s inn the air in the area is so clear that on most days from yovimpa and rainbow points navajo mountain and the kaibab plateau can be seen miles km away in arizona on extremely clear days the black mesas of eastern arizona and western new mexico can be seen some miles km away the park also has a magnitude night sky making it one of the darkest in north america stargazers can therefore see stars with the naked eye while in most places fewer than can be seen due to light pollution and in many large cities only a few dozen can be seen park rangers host public stargazing events and evening programs on astronomy nocturnal animals and night sky protection the bryce canyon astronomy festival typically held in june attracts thousands of visitors in honor of this astronomy festival asteroid was named after the national park there are two campgrounds in the park north campground and sunset campground loop a in north campground is open year round additional loops and sunset campground are
