cambrian when the region lay at the edge of a continental landmass called laurentia these rocks include the cambrian strata as the paleozoic era progressed several intensified geologic events occurred including repeated episodes of faulting and in turn orogenies which involved upward lifting of a metamorphic core complex creating mafic and rhyolitic dikes and stills extensive volcanism also occurred during the middle to late cambrian contributing further to the uplift of the area this also contributed to a second round of block faulting in which conglomerates ash flows and tuffs accumulated in the snake range wheeler peak both continuous and intermittent fault movements also occurred with individual fault surfaces on both sides of the snake range thinning and stretching glaciation glaciation mostly during a series of ice ages in the pleistocene heavily eroded the peaks of the snake range leaving canyon walls u shaped valleys cirques and moraines throughout the range lehman caves the lehman cave system began forming approximately million years ago during the cambrian while it was still submerged in a relatively warm shallow ocean the caves are made up of a marble and limestone solution for the most part that forms the many cave decorations throughout the caverns the cave system became much deeper during the pleistocene when a prolonged and increased flow of water eroded through the cave s fracturing bedrock eventually the water level dropped leaving glare rooms and cavities in the rock creating the depths of the lehman caves system scenic features edit the park s scenic features include lexington arch the lehman orchard and aqueduct rhodes cabin stella and teresa lakes and wheeler peak glacier lehman caves edit sunken gardens inside lehman caves the
