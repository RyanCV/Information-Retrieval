sangre de cristo range winter a dry year the park contains the tallest sand dunes in north america rising about feet m from the floor of the san luis valley on the western base of the sangre de cristo range covering about acres ha researchers say that the dunes started forming less than years ago the dunes were formed from sand and soil deposits of the rio grande and its tributaries flowing through the san luis valley over the ages glaciers feeding the river and the vast lake that existed upon the valley melted and the waters evaporated westerly winds picked up sand particles from the lake and river flood plain as the wind lost power before crossing the sangre de cristo range the sand was deposited on the east edge of the valley this process continues and the dunes are slowly growing the wind changes the shape of the dunes daily there are several streams flowing on the perimeter of the dunes the streams erode the edge of the dune field and sand is carried downstream the water disappears into the ground depositing sand on the surface winds pick up the deposits of sand and blow them up onto the dune field once again digging a couple inches into the dunes even at their peaks reveals wet sand part of the motivation of turning the monument into a national park was the extra protection of the water which colorado s cities and agriculture covet it is very easy to experience the dune building process this is a very windy region as hikers on the sand dunes will attest as on many days they will be pelted by sand and even small rocks when hiking on the dunes the wind carries sand and rocks from many miles away while the dunes don t change location or size that often there are still parabolic dunes that start in the sand sheet the outer area around the dunes and migrate towards the main dune field sometimes they join the main dune field and sometimes they will get covered with grass and vegetation and remain where they are the dunes are relatively stable however their morphology changes slightly with the seasons the direction of the wind greatly affects the dune type the winds normally go from southwest to northeast however during the late summer months the wind direction reverses causing reversing dunes this wind regime is part of the reason why the dunes are so tall the dunes contain areas of black sand which are deposits of magnetite a crystalline black oxide of iron climate edit the great sand dunes sit on a large area of high desert land in the san luis valley just west of the sangre de cristo mountains the summer temperatures of this area are not typical of normal high desert lands although temperatures above f c are not uncommon in july and august the large variation between high and low temperatures are typical of the high desert climate low temperatures during winter nights can be exceedingly cold with several night temperatures dropping below f c in the winter further off of the great sand dunes in this high desert valley precipitation numbers are exceedingly low however precipitation is still very low on the great sand dunes averaging just above inches mm of rainfall per year the high evaporation rates on the dunes qualify the area as desert land still even though precipitation exceeds inches mm it does snow on the dunes as well but snowfall is usually very short lived in the dry and sunny climate that is common

alpine lakes and tundra six peaks over feet m in elevation ancient spruce and pine forests large stands of aspen and cottonwood grasslands and wetlands all habitat for diverse wildlife and plant species one of the most unusual features of the park happens at medano creek which borders the east side of the dunes and is located next to the visitor center and bookstore because fresh sand continually falls in the creek medano creek never finds a permanent and stable streambed small underwater sand dunes that act like dams continually form and break down and so waders in the stream see surges which look like waves of water flowing downstream at intervals of anywhere from just a few seconds to a minute or more in a high water year these surges can be as much as a foot in height resembling ocean waves building sand castles with the creek sand is a popular visitor activity and skimboarding is a great activity for young people to do because only an inch or two of creek depth is needed zapata falls is a waterfall on the southeast side of the park and requires a short hike through a small cave to access view from a high dune one of the most valued features of the great sand dunes national park and preserve is one that cannot be seen according to a recent soundscape study conducted by the national park service this park is the quietest national park in the contiguous united states zapata falls many visitors to the site try to sled down the dunes the park service provides hints as to the best time to sled when the sand is wet and which equipment works best visitors anytime other than late fall through early spring are also advised to avoid bare feet or sandals and stick with sturdy closed footwear while the sand looks alluring its chocolate color absorbs heat the daylight sand temperature can reach f c and will burn bare feet plants and animals edit there are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands trees include douglass fir pinyon pine aspen rocky mountain juniper three leaf sumac bristlecone pine and red osier dogwood among the flowering plants are alpine phlox

park boundaries bow hunting is common in the preserve and ptarmigan are frequent targets of bow hunters mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it they are required to be leashed park history edit the dunes feet m tall at the base of the sangre de cristo range the dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in on november united states president bill clinton signed the great sand dunes national park and preserve act of aiming at ultimate national park status with the help of the nature conservancy the federal government purchased acres ha of the baca ranch which in effect tripled the size of the park the purchase includes those sections of the ranch which previously bordered the park on the north and west sides and also included foot m kit carson mountain and foot m subpeak challenger point and the water drainages to the south the land purchased was split into three sections part of the sangre de cristo mountains would be transferred to the rio grande national forest another section to the west would be set aside as a wildlife area and would host a wild bison herd and the last section to the east would be transferred from the rio grande national forest and would be open to some hunting references edit a b listing of acreage as of december land resource division
