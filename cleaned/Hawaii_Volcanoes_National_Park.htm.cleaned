environment edit the park includes acres sq mi km of land over half of the park is designated the hawaii volcanoes wilderness area and provides unusual hiking and camping opportunities the park encompasses diverse environments that range from sea level to the summit of the earth s most massive active volcano mauna loa at feet m climates range from lush tropical rain forests to the arid and barren kaʻ ū desert active eruptive sites include the main caldera of kīlauea and a more active but remote vent called puʻ u ʻ ōʻ ō the main entrance to the park is from the hawaii belt road the chain of craters road as the name implies leads past several craters from historic eruptions to the coast it used to continue to another entrance to the park near the town of kalapana but that portion is now covered by a lava flow history edit kīlauea and its halemaʻ umaʻ u caldera were traditionally considered the sacred home of the volcano goddess pele and hawaiians visited the crater to offer gifts to the goddess in a party of warriors along with women and children who were in the area were caught in an unusually violent eruption many were killed and others left footprints in the lava that can still be seen today the first western visitors to the site english missionary william ellis and american asa thurston went to kīlauea in ellis wrote of his reaction to the first sight of the erupting volcano a spectacle sublime and even appalling presented itself before us we stopped and trembled astonishment and awe for some moments rendered us mute and like statues we stood fixed to the spot with our eyes riveted on the abyss below the volcano became a tourist attraction in the s and local businessmen such as benjamin pitman and george lycurgus ran a series of hotels at the rim volcano house is the only hotel or restaurant located within the borders of the national park lorrin a thurston grandson of the american missionary asa thurston was one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the park after investing in the hotel from to william r castle first proposed the idea in thurston who then owned the honolulu advertiser newspaper printed editorials in favor of the park idea in the territory of hawaii paid for fifty members of congress and their wives to visit haleakala and kīlauea it included a dinner cooked over lava steam vents in thurston entertained secretary of the interior james rudolph garfield and in another congressional delegation governor walter f frear proposed a draft bill in to create kilauea national park for thurston and local landowner william herbert shipman proposed boundaries but ran into some opposition from ranchers thurston printed endorsements from john muir henry cabot lodge and former president theodore roosevelt after several attempts the legislation introduced by delegate jonah kūhiō kalaniana ole finally passed to create the park house resolution was signed by woodrow wilson on august it was the th national park in the united states and the first in a territory within a few weeks the national park service organic act would create the national park service to run the system originally called hawaii national park it was split from the haleakalā national park on september an easily accessible lava tube was named for the thurston family an undeveloped stretch of the thurston lava tube extends an additional ft m beyond the developed area and dead ends into the hillside though it is blocked by a chain link fence to keep unwary visitors from entering the easily traversed stretch is in fact open to the public and accessible through a gate in the fence park map including kahuku on left in an additional acres km of kahuku ranch were added to the park making it larger this was an area west of the town of waiʻ ōhinu and east of ocean view the largest land acquisition in hawaii s history the land was bought for us million from the samuel mills damon estate with financing from the nature conservancy geologic history hawaii volcanoes national park is located on the island of hawaii at the young end of the mile stretch of islands the islands are fairly young from less than million years at the youngest to nearly million at the oldest new formations continue to be formed today the islands are located on the top of the pacific plate the largest tectonic plate on earth due to sea floor spreading the plate continues to expand which has directly influenced the growth of the islands the two main active volcanoes in the hawaii volcanoes national park are mauna loa and kilauea mauna loa has an elevation of feet m and a mile km long mile km wide shield shaped dome it is the world s largest active volcano encompassing cubic miles similarly kilauea also has a shield shaped dome which is miles km long and miles km wide both volcanoes release more fluid and less gaseous eruptions which produce fiery fountains and rivers of molten lava due to these eruptions a desert like volcanic landscape has resulted amidst the national park specifically mauna loa has come to be the largest mountain on earth because of the multiple formations that took place during the pleistocene epoch the ninole formation which has left the oldest exposed lavas make up the core of the mountain as a result there are deep canyons that were made by lavas during the erosional period preceding the kahuki formation during this second stage of formations lava partially filled the canyons and built up the slopes of mauna loa the third formation ka u created younger lavas that covered the older lavas through these three formation periods mauna loa reached its current height at the end of the pleistocene epoch the development of the hawaii islands is due to the five shield volcanoes that erupted during the pleistocene period they are part of a volcanic chain located along the crest of the hawaiian emperor seamount chain similarly glaciation and changes in sea level have affected the geologic formation of the volcanoes in the national park a small icecap that once existed on the volcano of mauna kea during the pleistocene epoch that resulted in glaciers and has led to snow falls on both mauna kea and mauna loa volcanoes additionally changes in the sea level have resulted in land submergence and shorelines decreasing tree on fire near royal gardens subdivision in late january historic

in the artist s son harvey donated the painting to the hawaiʻi volcanoes national park where it was displayed in the visitors center from to the painting was criticized for portraying the hawaiian goddess as a caucasian arthur johnsen s pele in the volcano art center announced a competition for a more modern and culturally authentic rendering of the goddess an anonymous judging panel of native hawaiian elders selected a painting by arthur johnsen of pahoa hawaii from entries in johnsen s painting the goddess has distinctly polynesian features she is holding a digging stick ʻ ōʻ ō in her left hand and the egg that gave birth to her younger sister hiʻiaka in her right hand in the hitchcock was replaced with johnsen s painting recent events edit lava erupting from the puʻ u ʻ ōʻ ō vent for more details on this topic see halema uma u crater on march there was a small explosion in halemaʻ umaʻ u crater the first explosive event since and the first eruption in the kīlauea caldera since september debris from the explosion was scattered over an area of acres m a small amount of ash was also reported at a nearby community the explosion covered part of crater rim drive and damaged halemaʻ umaʻ u overlook the explosion did not release any lava which suggests to scientists that it was driven by hydrothermal or gas sources this explosion event followed the opening of a major sulfur dioxide gas vent greatly increasing levels emitted from the halemaʻ umaʻ u crater the dangerous increase of sulfur dioxide gas has prompted closures of crater rim drive between the jaggar
