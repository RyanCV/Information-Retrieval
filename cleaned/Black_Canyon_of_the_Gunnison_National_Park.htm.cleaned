n w n w area acres ha established october visitors in governing body national park service black canyon of the gunnison national park is a united states national park located in western colorado and managed by the national park service there are three entrances to the park the south rim entrance is located miles km east of montrose while the north rim entrance is miles km south of crawford and is closed in the winter the park contains miles km of the mile km long canyon of the gunnison river the national park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon but the canyon continues upstream into curecanti national recreation area and downstream into gunnison gorge national conservation area the canyon s name owes itself to the fact that parts of the gorge only receive minutes of sunlight a day according to images of america the black canyon of the gunnison in the book author duane vandenbusche states several canyons of the american west are longer and some are deeper but none combines the depth sheerness narrowness darkness and dread of the black canyon contents geology precambrian cretaceous tertiary quaternary history biology attractions references external links geology edit black canyon of the gunnison the gunnison river drops an average of feet per mile m km through the entire canyon making it the th steepest mountain descent in north america by comparison the colorado river drops an average of feet per mile m km through the grand canyon the greatest descent of the gunnison river occurs within the park at chasm view dropping feet per mile m km the black canyon is so named due its steepness which makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate into its depths as a result the canyon is often shrouded in shadow causing the rocky walls to appear black at its narrowest point the canyon is only ft m wide at the river the extremely narrow walls of the canyon overview black canyon with gunnison river the extreme steepness and depth of the black canyon formed as the result of several geologic processes acting together the gunnison river is primarily responsible for carving the canyon though several other geologic events had to occur in order to form the canyon as it is seen today painted wall on the north side of the canyon it is the tallest sheer cliff in colorado at feet m lighter colored pegmatite dikes are clearly visible precambrian edit the precambrian gneiss and schist that make up the majority of the steep walls of the black canyon formed billion years ago during a metamorphic period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present day wyoming the lighter colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting the basement rocks formed later during this same period cretaceous tertiary edit the entire area underwent uplift during the laramide orogeny between and million years ago which was also part of the gunnison uplift this raised the precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up the canyon walls during the tertiary from to million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day black canyon the west elk mountains la sal mountains henry mountains and abajo mountains all contributed to burying the area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris the modern gunnison river set its course million years ago as the run off from the nearby la sal and west elk mountains and the sawatch range began carving through the relatively soft volcanic deposits quaternary edit with the gunnison river s course set a broad uplift in the area to million years ago caused the river to cut through the softer volcanic deposits eventually the river reached the precambrian rocks of the gunnison uplift since the river was unable to change its course it began scouring through the extremely hard metamorphic rocks of the gunnison uplift the river s flow was much larger than currently with much higher levels of turbidity as a result the river dug down through the precambrian gneiss and schist at the rate of inch mm every years the extreme hardness of the metamorphic rock along with the relative quickness with which the river carved through them created the steep walls that can be seen today a number of feeder canyons running into the black canyon slope in the wrong direction for water to flow into the canyon it is believed that less entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain the west flowing gunnison however was essentially trapped in the hard precambrian rock of the black canyon and could not change its course history edit the ute indians had known the canyon to exist for a long time before the first europeans saw it they referred to the river as much rocks big water and are known to have avoided the canyon out of superstition by the time the united states declared independence in two spanish expeditions had passed by the canyons in the s the numerous fur trappers searching for beaver pelts would have known of the canyon s existence but they left no written record the first official account of the black canyon was provided by captain john williams gunnison in who was leading an expedition to survey a route from saint louis and san francisco he described the country to be the roughest most hilly and most cut up he had ever seen and skirted the canyon south towards present day montrose following his death at the hands of ute indians later that year the river that captain gunnison had called the grand was renamed in his honor in william jackson palmer s denver and rio grande railroad had reached gunnison from denver the line was built to provide a link to the burgeoning gold and silver mines of the san juan mountains the rugged terrain precluded using standard rail palmer decided to go with the narrower gauge it took over a year for irish and italian laborers to carve out a mile roadbed from sapinero to cimarron costing a staggering a mile the last mile is said to have cost more than the entire royal gorge project on august the first passenger train passed through the black canyon the editor of the gunnison review press rode in one of the observation cars he remarked that the canyon was undoubtedly the largest and most rugged canon in the world traversed by the iron horse we had often heard of the scenery of this canyon but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it it is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet throughout its entire length there is probably not a quarter of a mile of straight track on it it is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp in hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track he went on to proclaim another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in the world and there is probably no section of colorado or of the whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found in the hopes of running the railroad through the rest of the black canyon palmer sent his top engineer bryan bryant on an inner canyon exploration bryant set off with a man crew in december expecting to complete the survey in days he returned in eight of the twelve man crew left after a few days terrified of the task in front of them what the rest of the men saw was spectacular and had never been seen by another human bryant reported that the black canyon was impenetrable and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths heeding bryant s advice palmer decided to route the railroad south of the canyon and in march it completed its connection to salt lake city and for a brief period the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system while the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path to utah and mines to the southwest later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment rudyard kipling described his ride through the canyon in the following words we entered a gorge remote from the sun where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer and where a rock splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and pinning a few rails a top there was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about the mad ride which i felt keenly by an alternate route through glenwood springs had been completed and the route through the black canyon being more difficult to operate lost importance for through trains the route was finally abandoned in in the u s geological survey sent abraham lincoln fellows and william torrence into the canyon to look for a site to build a diversion tunnel bringing water to the uncompahgre valley which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area torrence a montrose native and an expert mountaineer had taken part in a failed expedition the previous year and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion he opted to bring a single rubber air mattress instead of the heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey into the canyon they entered the canyon on august equipped with only hunting knives two silk lifeline ropes and rubber bags to encase their instruments after a harrowing days braving rock falls waterfalls and river crossings they emerged from the canyon with a suitable tunnel site construction on the tunnel began years later and was fraught with difficulties right from the onset working conditions at the tunnel were difficult due to the high levels of carbon dioxide excessive temperatures humidity water mud shale sand and a fractured fault zone it took the tunneling crew almost one year to bore through feet of water filled rock the tunnel was driven through granite quartzite gneiss and shale as well as layers of sandstone coal and limestone work on the gunnison tunnel was first done manually and by candlelight one miner would hold the drill and rotate it while the second miner would use a sledgehammer to drive the drill into the rock this work required strong hard working men in spite of good pay and fringe benefits most disliked the dangerous underground conditions and stayed an average of only weeks men were killed during the year undertaking the tunnel was finally completed in stretching a distance of miles and costing nearly million dollars at the time the gunnison tunnel held the honor of being the world s longest irrigation tunnel on september president william howard taft dedicated the tunnel in montrose the east portal of the gunnison tunnel is accessible via east portal road which is on the south rim of the canyon although the tunnel itself is not visible the diversion dam can be seen from the campground the black canyon of the gunnison was established as a u s national monument on march it became a national park on october during the civilian conservation corps built the north rim road to design by the national park service this includes fives miles of roadway and five overlooks it is listed on the u s national register of historic places as a historic district biology edit great horned owl chicks nesting in the rocky mountains juniper tree near the top of the canyon the black canyon of the gunnison national park contains a wide variety of flora and fauna some common plants native to the park include aspen ponderosa pine sagebrush desert mahogany cercocarpus ledifolius utah juniper gambel oak scrub oak and single leaf ash the black canyon gilia aliciella penstemonoides is a species of wildflower native to the park wildlife in the park include the coyote elk magpie eagle and mule deer in addition the canyon is the home of a number of resident birds including the great horned owl american dipper and steller s jay as well as migratory birds such as the mountain bluebird peregrine falcon white throated swift and canyon wren attractions edit an estimated tourists visit the park annually the main attraction of the park is the scenic drive along us highway and colorado highway as well as the south rim the west end of the park where it meet blue mesa reservoir at blue mesa point is the area most developed for camping it includes tent camping and rv parking with full hookups as well as canyon tours hiking fishing and boat tours the west end of the park has river access by automobile as well as guided tours of the canyon a short hike at blue mesa point information center heads down to pine creek and the morrow point boat tours boating fishing and hiking at the south rim there are two campgrounds and several hiking and nature trails the north rim is quite beautiful it is also accessible by automobile and has a small primitive campground automobiles can access the river via the east portal road at the south rim this road has a grade and is prohibited to vehicles over feet m in length the river can also be accessed by steep unmaintained trails called routes or draws on the north and south rim these routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up depending on which route is taken all inner canyon descents are strenuous and require class climbing and basic route finding skills steep talus impassable ledges and lack of cover are some of the challenges hikers are faced with poison ivy also grows abundantly in the draws and on the canyon floor long sleeves and hiking boots are strongly recommended the flow rate of the gunnison river should also be considered for those planning on camping in the canyon as high river levels can wash out the camp sites the national park service warns the following routes are difficult to follow and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes hikers are expected to find their own way and to be prepared for self rescue a free back country permit is required for all inner canyon use except at the west end the gunnison river is designated as a gold medal water from yards downstream of crystal reservoir dam to the north fork this includes the miles within the black canyon of the gunnison national park only artificial flies and lures are permitted and all rainbow trout are catch and release additionally fishing is prohibited within yards downstream of crystal dam the black canyon is a center for rock climbing in a style known as traditional climbing most of the climbs are difficult and attempted only by advanced climbers rafting opportunities exist in the region but the run through the park itself is a difficult technical run for only the best kayakers there are several impassable stretches of water requiring long sometimes dangerous portages the remaining rapids are class iii v and are only for expert river runners downstream in the gunnison gorge national conservation area the river is somewhat easier to navigate though still very remote and only for experienced runners with rapids that are class iii iv references edit listing of acreage as of december land resource
