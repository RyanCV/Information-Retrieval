bat are the only native mammals two large fruit bats samoa flying fox and white naped flying fox and a small insectivore the pacific sheath tailed bat they serve an important role in pollinating the

over coral species some of the largest living coral colonies porites in the world are at ta u island history edit the national park of american samoa was established on october by public law but the nps could not buy the land because of traditional communal land system this was resolved on september when the national park service entered into a year lease for the park land from the samoan village

and the destruction of about homes and businesses the park encountered major damage the visitor center and main office were destroyed but there was only one reported injury among the nps staff and volunteers geologic history edit the volcanic islands of samoa that dominate the acreage of the national park are composed of shield volcanoes which developed from a hot spot on the pacific plate emerging sequentially from west to east tutulia the largest and oldest island probably dates from the pliocene epoch approximately to million years ago while the smaller islands are most likely holocene in age the islands are not made up of individual volcanoes but are rather composed of overlapping and superimposed shield volcanoes built by basalt lava flows much of the lava that erupted has since broken into angular fragments known as breccia the volcanoes emerged from the intrusion of basaltic dikes from a rift zone on the ocean floor during the pliocene epoch and were heavily eroded during the pliocene and early pleistocene epochs leaving behind trachyte plugs and exposed outcrops of volcanic tuff throughout the park ta u island the youngest of the islands included within the national park is all that remains from the collapse of a shield volcano during holocene time this collapse produced sea cliffs over feet high on the north side of the island some of the highest such escarpments in the world while the samoan islands have not shown evidence of volcanism for many years the hot spot beneath the islands continues to give indications of activity with a submarine eruption detected just east of american samoa in the vailulu u seamount located east of ta u is a future samoan island developing from submarine lava flows continuing the eastward progress of volcanic development from the hotspot below the islands the lava flows forming the seamount have been dated by radiometric methods to between and years during which time the seamount has risen feet from the ocean floor evidence exists of past submarine and surface landslides as a result of weathering and other forms of erosion of the rocks and soil making up the islands on ta u island an inland escarpment known as liu bench a feature of mass wasting threatens to slump into the nearby ocean an event which could produce a tsunami strong enough to devastate the island of fiji to the southeast threats edit the coral reefs are under significant threat due to rising ocean temperatures and carbon dioxide concentration as well as sea level rise as a result of these and other stresses the corals that form the reefs are projected to be lost by mid century if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at their current rate see also edit samoan plant names list of birds of samoa old vatia an
