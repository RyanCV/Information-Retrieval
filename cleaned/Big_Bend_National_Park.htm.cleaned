covers acres ha a variety of cretaceous and cenozoic fossil organisms exist in abundance and the park has artifacts estimated to be years old historic buildings and landscapes offer graphic illustration of life along the international border in the th century for more than miles km the rio grande río bravo forms the international boundary between mexico and the united states and big bend national park administers approximately miles km along that boundary the park was named after the area which is bounded by a large bend in the river and texas mexico border see map at right below because the rio grande serves as an international boundary the park faces unusual constraints while administering and enforcing park rules regulations and policies in accordance with the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo the park s territory extends only to the center of the deepest river channel as the river flowed in the rest of the land south of that channel and the river lies within mexican territory contents geography and climate geology cultural resources human history flora and fauna tourist information gallery see also references bibliography external links geography and climate edit the park exhibits dramatic contrasts and its climate may be characterized as one of extremes dry and hot late spring and summer days often exceed f c in the lower elevations winters are normally mild but subfreezing temperatures occasionally occur because of the range in altitude from about feet m along the river to emory peak in the chisos mountains at feet m a wide variation in available moisture and temperature exists throughout the park these variations contribute to an exceptional diversity in plant and animal habitats some species in the park such as the chisos oak quercus gravesii are found nowhere else in the united states the mi km of river that form the southern park boundary include the spectacular canyons of santa elena mariscal and boquillas the rio grande which meanders through this portion of the chihuahuan desert has cut deep canyons with nearly vertical walls through three uplifts made primarily of limestone throughout the open desert areas the highly productive rio grande riparian zone includes numerous plant and animal species and significant cultural resources the vegetative belt extends into the desert along creeks and arroyos south of the border lie the mexican states of chihuahua and coahuila and newly protected areas for flora and fauna which are regions known as the maderas del carmen and the cañón de santa elena in the park was named as an international dark sky park by the international dark sky association which recognized the park as one of only ten places in the world certified for dark sky stargazing in addition the association recognized the park as having the darkest measured skies in the lower united states on many nights park visitors can look up to the night s sky to see thousands of stars bright planets and the clear outline of the milky way band astronomers both professional and amateur are seen on many moonless nights gazing up at the stars through portable telescopes climate data for castolon weather

in the park is related to the paleozoic marathon orogeny although proterozoic events over mya possibly have some deep control the marathon orogeny part of the ouachita marathon sonora orogenic belt is part of thrusting of rocks from the south american plate over the north american plate this can be best seen in the persimmon gap area of the park this orogenic event is linked to the lack of triassic and jurassic age rocks in the park between the triassic and the cretaceous the south american plate rifted from the north american plate resulting in the deposition of the glen rose limestone del carmen limestone sue peaks formation santa elena limestone del rio clay buda limestone and boquillas formations preserved in the sierra del carmen santiago mountains nine point mesa mariscal mountain and mesa de anguila areas also during this time the chihuahua trough formed as the gulf of mexico opened which resulted in east west striking normal faulting as a result of this depositional time dinosaur forest and other fossils are preserved in the park following the ending of rifting in the late cretaceous to the early cenozoic the big bend area was subjected to the laramide orogeny this period of now east west compression caused the northeast facing mesa de anguila an uplifted monocline on the southwest margin of the park the southwest facing sierra del carmen santiago mountains an uplifted and thrust faulted monocline that forms the boundary of the park on the east and the tornillo basin during the middle cenozoic most of the volcanic rocks including the chisos group the pine canyon caldera complex and the burro mesa formation formed the most recent tectonic activity in the park is basin and range faulting from the neogene to quaternary this period of east west extension has resulted in estufa and dehalo bolsons in the chisos mountains as well as the terlingua and sierra del carmen chalk draw and burro mesa faults the rio grande has entered the big bend area roughly mya and since then extensive erosion and downcutting have occurred cultural resources edit cultural resources in the park range from the paleo indian period years ago through the historic period represented by native american groups such as the chisos mescaleros and comanche more recently spanish mexican anglo and irish settlers farmed ranched and mined in the area throughout the prehistoric period humans found shelter and maintained open campsites throughout the park the archeological record reveals an archaic period desert culture whose inhabitants developed a nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged for several thousand years the historic cultural landscape centers upon various subsistence or commercial land uses the riparian and tributary environments were used for subsistence and irrigation farming transportation networks irrigation structures simple domestic residences and outbuildings and planed and terraced farm land lining the stream banks characterize these landscapes human history edit pine canyon falls inside big bend national park during the early historic period before several indian groups were recorded as inhabiting the big bend the chisos indians were a loosely organized group of nomadic hunters and gatherers who probably practiced limited agriculture on a seasonal basis the origin of the chisos indians is not known linguistically they were associated with the conchos indians of northern chihuahua and northwestern coahuila their language group spoke a variation of uto aztecan a language whose speakers ranged from central mexico to the great basin of the u s the jumano was a nomadic group that traveled and traded throughout west texas and southeastern new mexico but some historic records indicate they were enemies of the chisos around the beginning of the th century the mescalero apaches began to invade the big bend region and displaced the chisos indians one of the last native american groups to use the big bend was the comanches who passed through the park along the comanche trail on their way to and from periodic raids into the mexican interior these raids continued until the mid th century the last of the great military leaders of the native peoples of the region was an apache of spanish ancestry named alzate who was active as late as the late s the european presence in the region begins circa ad with the first spanish explorations into this portion of north america the expedition of álvar núñez cabeza de vaca passed near the big bend and was followed by other expeditions some of these expeditions were searching for gold and silver or farm and ranch land others such as those by the franciscan missionaries were intended to establish centers in which the natives could be evangelized in an attempt to protect the northern frontier of the new spain from which emerged present day mexico a line of presidios or forts was established along the rio grande in the late th century the presidio de san vicente was built near present day san vicente coahuila and the presidio de san carlos was built near present day manuel benavides chihuahua some of the presidios were soon abandoned because of financial difficulties and because they could not effectively stop indian intrusions into mexico the soldiers and settlers of these presidios moved to newer presidios where the interests of the spanish empire were more defensible such was the case of santa rosa maria del sacramento now muzquiz coahuila very little study has been made of the spanish occupation of the big bend following the abandonment of the presidios in a spanish settlement called altares existed mi km south of the rio grande the region became a part of mexico when it achieved its independence from spain in mexican families lived in the area when english speaking settlers began arriving following the secession of texas during the latter half of the th century following the end of the mexican american war in the u s army made military surveys of the uncharted land of the big bend forts and outposts were established across trans pecos texas to protect migrating settlers from indian attacks a significant proportion of the soldiers in the late s were african american and came to be called the buffalo soldiers a name apparently given to them by the native americans lieutenant henry flipper the first american of african ancestry to graduate from west point served in shafter texas near the end of the th century shafter named for him lies west of the big bend along the highway from presidio to marfa ranchers began to settle in the big bend about and by sheep goat and cattle ranches occupied most of the area the delicate desert environment was soon overgrazed in the late th and early th century valuable mineral deposits were discovered and brought settlers who worked in the mines or supported the mines by farming or by cutting timber for the mines and smelters communities sprang up around the mines boquillas and terlingua all resulted from mining operations during this period the rio grande flood plain was settled by farmers settlements developed with names like terlingua abajo san vicente la coyota and castolon often no more than clusters of families were living and farming in the same area and they were successful only to the degree that the land was able to support them in the s many people who loved the big bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations in the texas legislature passed legislation to establish texas canyons state park later that year the park was redesignated big bend state park in the united states congress passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park the state of texas deeded the land that it had acquired to the federal government and on june big bend national park became a reality the park opened to visitors on july flora and fauna edit a javelina in big bend bluebonnets in big bend despite its harsh desert environment big bend has more than species of plants including cactus species over species of vertebrates and about insect species the variety of life is largely due to the diverse ecology and changes in elevation between the dry hot desert the cool mountains and the fertile river valley most of the animals are not visible in the day particularly in the desert the park comes alive at night with many of the animals foraging for food about cougar puma concolor sightings are reported per year despite the fact that only two dozen cougars live in the park other species that inhabit the park include black tailed jackrabbit lepus californicus kangaroo rat dipodomys spp greater roadrunner geococcyx californianus golden eagle aquila chrysaetos collared peccary pecari tajacu and coyote canis latrans mexican black bears ursus americanus eremicus are also present in the mountain areas the

to the only area in the united states within the breeding range of the colima warbler vermivora crissalis plans to reintroduce the mexican wolf to big bend national park were rejected in the late s by the state of texas disagreement over the reintroduction included the question of whether the park contained enough prey animals such as deer and javelinas to sustain a wolf population tourist information edit big bend is one of the largest most remote and least visited national parks in the lower united states in recent years only visitors have entered the park annually big bend s primary attraction is its hiking and backpacking trails particularly notable among these are the chimneys trail which visits a rock formation in the desert the marufo vega trail a loop trail that passes through scenic canyons on the way to and from the rio grande the south rim trail which circles the high mountains of the chisos and the outer mountain loop trail in the chisos which incorporates parts of the south rim loop descends into the desert along the dodson trail and then returns to the chisos basin completing a mile loop other notable locations include santa elena canyon grapevine hills and the mule ears two imposing rock towers in the middle of the desert professional backpacking guide services provide trips in the park the park administers miles km of the rio grande for recreational use professional river outfitters provide tours of the river use of a personal boat is permitted but a free river float permit is required in june the department of homeland security began treating all float trips as trips that had left the country and required participants to have an acceptable form of identification such as a passport to re enter the country visitors often crossed the rio grande to visit the mexican village of boquillas but the department of homeland security closed the border crossing in in april the boquillas crossing reopened as an official class b port of entry between the u s and mexico it is open wednesday through sunday between am and pm with more than species of birds recorded in the park a widely popular activity is birdwatching many species stop in the park during their annual migrations five paved roads are in big bend persimmon gap to panther junction is a mile km road from the north entrance of the park to park headquarters at panther junction
