arches national park the national park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed which is the main cause of the formation of the arches spires balanced rocks sandstone fins and eroded monoliths in the area this salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places and was deposited in the paradox basin of the colorado plateau some million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated over millions of years the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the uncompahgre uplift to the northeast during the early jurassic about ma desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast navajo sandstone was deposited an additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments the entrada sandstone about ma was deposited on top of the navajo over feet m of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the cretaceous mancos shale the arches of the area are developed mostly within the entrada formation the weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes the evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes in some places they turned almost on edge the result of one such foot m displacement the moab fault is seen from the visitor center delicate arch with background of la sal mountains as this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface except for isolated remnants the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon colored entrada sandstone in which most of the arches form and the buff colored navajo sandstone these are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park over time water seeped into the surface cracks joints and folds of these layers ice formed in the fissures expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock breaking off bits and pieces winds later cleaned out the loose particles a series of free standing fins remained wind and water attacked these fins until in some the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out many damaged fins collapsed others with the right degree of hardness and balance survived despite their missing sections these became the famous arches although the park s terrain appears rugged and durable it is the exact opposite more than visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem the problem lies within the soil s crust which is composed of cyanobacteria algae fungi and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park factors that make arches national park sensitive to visitor damage include semiarid region and the scarce unpredictable rainfall lack of deep freezing and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to and slow recovery from compressional forces such as foot traffic methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index measuring of water infiltration and t tests that are used to compare the values from the

lived in the area up until about years ago spanish missionaries encountered ute and paiute tribes in the area when they first came through in but the first european americans to attempt settlement in the area were the mormon elk mountain mission in who soon abandoned the area ranchers farmers and prospectors later settled moab in the neighboring riverine valley in the s word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations spread beyond the settlement as a possible tourist destination the arches area was first brought to the attention of the national park service by frank a wadleigh passenger traffic manager of the denver and rio grande western railroad wadleigh accompanied by railroad photographer george l beam visited the area in september at the invitation of alexander ringhoffer a hungarian born prospector living in salt valley ringhoffer had written to the railroad in an effort to interest them in the tourist potential of a scenic area he had discovered the previous year with his two sons and a son in law which he called the devil s garden known today as the klondike bluffs wadleigh was impressed by what ringhoffer showed him and suggested to park service director stephen t mather that the area be made a national monument a panoramic view of sandstone fins of the fiery furnace a panoramic view of tower of babel the following year additional support for the monument idea came from laurence gould a university of michigan graduate student and future polar explorer studying the geology of the nearby la sal mountains who was shown the scenic area by local physician dr j w doc williams a succession of government investigators examined the area in part due to confusion as to the precise location in the process the name devil s garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of salt valley and ringhoffer s original discovery was omitted while another area nearby known locally as the windows was included designation of the area as a national monument was supported by the park service from but was resisted by president calvin coolidge s interior secretary hubert work finally in april shortly after his inauguration president herbert hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating arches national monument consisting of two comparatively small disconnected sections the purpose of the reservation under the antiquities act was to protect the arches spires balanced rocks and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value the name arches was suggested by frank pinkely superintendent of the park service s southwestern national monuments following a visit to the windows section in in late president franklin d roosevelt signed a proclamation which enlarged arches to protect additional scenic features and permit development of facilities to promote tourism a small adjustment was made by president dwight eisenhower in to accommodate a new road alignment in early just before leaving office president lyndon b johnson signed a proclamation substantially enlarging arches two years later president richard nixon signed legislation enacted by congress which significantly reduced the total area enclosed but changed its status to a national park recreational activities edit the three gossips exit rappel on the popular elephant butte a rock formation in the park climbing on named arches within the park has
