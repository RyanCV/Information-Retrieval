served as the coastline for an inland sea present in the sea was a plethora of marine life whose remains formed a reef unlike modern reef growths the permian reef contained bryozoans sponges and other microorganisms after the permian period most of the water evaporated and the reef was buried by evaporites and other sediments tectonic movement occurred during the late cenozoic uplifting the reef above ground susceptible to erosion water sculpted the guadalupe mountain region into its present day state speleogenesis edit carlsbad caverns national park is situated in a bed of limestone above groundwater level during cavern development it was within the groundwater zone citation needed deep below the limestones are petroleum reserves part of the mid continent oil field at a time near the end of the cenozoic hydrogen sulfide h s began to seep upwards from the petroleum into the groundwater the combination of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen from the water formed sulfuric acid h s o h so the sulfuric acid then continued upward aggressively dissolving the limestone deposits to form caverns the presence of gypsum within the cave is a confirmation of the occurrence of this process as it is a byproduct of the reaction between sulfuric acid and limestone once the acidic groundwater drained from the caverns speleothems began to be deposited within the cavern erosion above ground created the natural entrance to the carlsbad caverns within the last million years exposure to the surface has allowed for the influx of air into the cavern rainwater and snowmelt percolating downward into the ground pick up carbon dioxide once this water reaches a cavern ceiling it precipitates and evaporates leaving behind a small calcium carbonate deposit growths from the roof downward formed through this process are known as stalactites additionally water on the floor of the caverns can contain carbonic acid and generate mineral deposits by evaporation growths from the floor upward through this process are known as stalagmites different formations of speleothems include columns soda straws draperies helictites and popcorn changes in the ambient air temperature and rainfall affect the rate of growth of speleothems as higher temperatures increase carbon dioxide production rates within the overlying soil color of speleothems is determined by the trace constituents in the minerals of the formation citation needed history edit while a young boy jim white explored the cavern with his homemade wire ladder when he grew older there was considerable doubt as to whether the caves actually existed he named many of the rooms including the big room new mexico room kings palace queens chamber papoose room and green lake room he also named many of the cave s more prominent formations such as the totem pole witch s finger giant dome bottomless pit fairyland iceberg rock temple of the sun and rock of ages the town of carlsbad which lends its name to the cavern and national park is in

the several chambers contain stalactites stalagmites and other formations in such unusual number size beauty of form and variety of figure as to make this a cavern equal if not superior in both

parties are hosted by the park at night rangers host informational programs on the celestial night sky and telescopes are also made available these parties are often held in conjunction with special astronomical events such as a transit of venus recent exploration edit in a very distinctive method of exploration was invented in a dome area feet m above the big room floor not far from the bottomless pit a stalagmite leaned out using a balsa wood loop with helium filled balloons attached the explorers after several tries over several years floated a lightweight cord that snagged the target stalagmite once the cord was in position up over and back to the ground a climbing rope was pulled into position and the explorers ascended into what they named the spirit world a similar smaller room was found in the main entrance corridor and was named balloon ballroom in honor of this technique in a series of small passages totaling nearly a mile in combined length was found in the ceiling of the new mexico room named chocolate high it was the largest discovery in the cave since the guadalupe room was found in the bottomless pit was originally said to have no bottom stones were tossed into it but no sound of the stones striking the bottom was heard later exploration revealed the bottom was about feet m deep and covered with soft dirt the stones made no sound when they struck the bottom because they were lodged in the soft soil on october a cave technician exploring the spirit world area discovered a new chamber hundreds of feet up from the main area dubbed halloween hall for the date of its discovery the fresh find marks the biggest discovery for the caverns in more than years the room s diameter is about feet m and more than bat bones were discovered inside the room other caves edit the park contains over caves three caves are open to public tours carlsbad caverns is the most famous and is fully developed with electric lights paved trails and elevators slaughter canyon cave and spider cave are undeveloped excepted for designated paths for the guided adventure caving tours lechuguilla cave is well known for its delicate speleothems and pristine underground environment guano mining occurred in the pit below the entrance in the s after gaining permission from the national park managers to dig into a rubble pile where wind whistled between the rocks when the weather changed cavers broke through into a room in over miles km of cave passage has been explored and mapped it has been mapped to a depth of feet m making it the second deepest limestone cave in the u s to protect the fragile environment access is limited to permitted scientific expeditions only bats edit mexican free tailed bats emerging from the natural entrance and flying to the nearest water seventeen species of bats live in the park including a large number of mexican free tailed bats it has been estimated that the population of mexican free tailed bats once numbered in the millions but has declined drastically in modern times the cause of this decline is unknown but the pesticide ddt is often listed as a primary cause populations appear to be on the increase in recent years but significantly below the levels formerly estimated to have been present citation needed a study published in by a team from boston university questions whether millions of bats ever existed in the caverns many techniques have been used to estimate the bat population in the cave the most recent and most successful of these attempts involved the use of thermal imaging camera to track and count the bats a count from estimated a peak of the mexican free tailed bats are present from april or may to late october or early november they emerge in a dense group corkscrewing upwards and counterclockwise usually starting around sunset and lasting about three hours jim white decided to investigate the caverns when he saw the bats from a distance and at first thought they were a volcano or a whirlwind every early evening from memorial day weekend to mid october with possible exceptions for bad weather a ranger gives a talk on the bats while visitors sitting in the amphitheater wait to watch the bats come out other attractions edit carlsbad cavern amphitheater three hiking trails and an unpaved drive provide access to the desert scenery and ecosystem the developed portion around
