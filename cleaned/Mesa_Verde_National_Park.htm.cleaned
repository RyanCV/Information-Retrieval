references external links inhabitants edit paleo indians edit paleo indians hunting a glyptodont by heinrich harder c the first occupants of the mesa verde region which spans from southeastern utah to northwestern new mexico were nomadic paleo indians who arrived in the area c bce they followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the san juan mountains receded the earliest paleo indians were the clovis culture and folsom tradition defined largely by the way in which they fashioned projectile points although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region there is little indication that they lived in central mesa verde during this time after bce the area s environment grew warmer and drier which brought pine forests and the animals that thrive in them to central mesa verde paleo indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers c though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year round residents development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game a crucial advance at a time when most of the region s big game had disappeared from the landscape archaic edit archaic pictographs c bce sego canyon utah bce marks the beginning of the archaic period in north america archeologists differ as to the origin of the mesa verde archaic population some believe they developed exclusively from local paleo indians called the foothills mountain complex but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in mesa verde indicates influence from surrounding areas including the great basin the san juan basin and the rio grande valley the archaic people probably developed locally but were also influenced by contact trade and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas the early archaic people living near mesa verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the paleo indians had while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle they inhabited the outlying areas of the mesa verde region but also the mountains mesa tops and canyons where they created rockshelters and rock art and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration major warming and drying from to might have led middle archaic people to seek the cooler climate of mesa verde whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that when coupled with spring rains provided relatively plentiful amounts of water by the late archaic more people were living in semi permanent rockshelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets sandals and mats they started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer the late archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as obsidian and turquoise marine shells and abalone from the pacific coast made their way to mesa verde from arizona and the archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants rock art flourished and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the archaic period c basketmaker culture edit basketmaker ii basket c to with the introduction of corn to the mesa verde region c bce and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent pithouse settlements the archaic mesa verdeans transitioned into what archeologists call the basketmaker culture basketmaker ii people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills use of the atlatl and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery by corn had become the preeminent staple of the basketmaker ii people s diet which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops a in addition to the fine basketry for which they were named basketmaker ii people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials including sandals robes pouches mats and blankets they also made clay pipes and gaming pieces basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular averaging less than feet m tall their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel including degenerative joint disease healed fractures and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency they buried the dead near or amongst their settlements and often included luxury items as gifts which might indicate differences in relative social status basketmaker ii people are also known for their distinctive rock art which can be found throughout mesa verde they depicted animals and people in both abstract and realistic forms in single works and more elaborate panels a common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the hopi call kokopelli basketmaker iii basket c to by ce atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery marking the end of the basketmaker ii era and the beginning of the basketmaker iii era ceramic vessels were a major improvement over pitch lined baskets gourds and animal hide containers which had been the primary water storage containers in the region pottery also protected seeds against mold insects and rodents by mesa verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews year round settlements first appear around this time the population of the san juan basin increased markedly after when there were very few basketmaker iii sites in mesa verde by the early th century there were many such sites in the mesa for the next years villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences the population of mesa verde c was approximately to people beans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region c by some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people the construction of large above ground storage buildings began around this time basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields by the end of the th century the smaller hamlets which were typically occupied for ten to forty years had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations basketmaker iii people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures ancestral puebloans edit main article ancestral puebloans pueblo i to edit main article pueblo i period major ancestral puebloan settlements in the san juan basin pueblo i protokiva on chapin mesa mesa verde national park marks the end of the basketmaker iii era and the beginning of the pueblo i period the transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities pueblo i people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected year round residences called pueblos many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above ground dwellings this altered the function of pithouses from all purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies although they continued to house large extended families particularly during winter months during the late th century mesa verdeans began building square pit structures that archeologists call protokivas they were typically or feet or m deep and to feet to m wide the first pueblos appeared at mesa verde sometime after by more than half of mesa verdeans lived in them as local populations grew puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting foraging and gardening which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn this shift from semi nomadism to a sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral pueblo society forever within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty with average populations of two hundred people population density increased dramatically with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two this brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents it also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans and by the late th century as mesa verde s population was being augmented by settlers from the south four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages large pueblo i settlements laid claim to the resources found within to square miles to km they were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about mile km apart by there were approximately people living in mesa verde within the plazas of larger villages the pueblo i people dug massive pit structures of square feet m that became central gathering places these structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the pueblo ii era great houses of chaco canyon despite robust growth during the early and mid th century unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area many late pueblo i villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation and by mesa verde s population was in steady decline the beginning of the th century saw widespread depopulation of the region as people emigrated south of the san juan river to chaco canyon in search of reliable rains for farming as mesa verdeans migrated south to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before the influence of chaco canyon grew and by chaco had supplanted mesa verde as the region s cultural center pueblo ii to edit main article pueblo ii period square tower house the pueblo ii period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of chaco canyon despite their participation in the vast chacoan system mesa verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition inspiring further architectural advancements the th century mesa verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of chacoan great house construction droughts during the late th century rendered mesa verdean dry land farming unreliable which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next years crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early th century by the population of the area began to rebound as agricultural prosperity increased people immigrated to mesa verde from the south mesa verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the pueblo ii era during the th century they built check dams and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff these fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields by the mid th and early th centuries protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas which were usually to feet to m across these mesa verde style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a sipapu which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber that symbolizes the ancestral puebloan s place of emergence from the underworld at this time mesa verdeans began to move away from the post and mud jacal style buildings that marked the pueblo i period toward masonry construction which had been utilized in the region as early as but was not widespread until the th and th centuries the expansion of chacoan influence in the mesa verde area left its most visible mark in the form of chaco style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many mesa verdean villages after far view house the largest of these is considered a classic chaco outlier on which construction likely began between and although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as the era s timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years during the early th century the locus of regional control shifted away from chaco to aztec new mexico in the southern mesa verde region b by drought had once again stressed the region s inhabitants leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at mesa verde pueblo iii to edit main article pueblo iii period cliff palace is the largest cliff dwelling in mesa verde national park a severe drought from to led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the san juan basin particularly at chaco canyon as the extensive chacoan system collapsed people increasingly migrated to mesa verde causing major population growth in the area this led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people which reduced mobility for mesa verdeans who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy in order to sustain these larger populations they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the mesa verdeans had relied on further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought related failure the chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to mesa verde during the late th and early th centuries including pottery shells and turquoise but by the late th century as the system collapsed the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined and mesa verde became isolated from the surrounding region for approximately six hundred years most mesa verdean farmers had lived in small mesa top homesteads of one or two families they were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water this practice continued into the mid to late th century but by the start of the th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields mesa verdean villages thrived during the mid pueblo iii era when architects constructed massive multi story buildings and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs structures built during this period have been described as among the world s greatest archaeological treasures pueblo iii masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years more than double the usable lifespan of the pueblo ii jacal structures others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more architectural innovations such as towers and multi walled structures also appear during the pueblo iii era mesa verde s population remained fairly stable during the th century drought at the start of the th century approximately people lived there the area saw moderate population increases during the following decades and dramatic ones from to most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as yellow jacket pueblo near cortez colorado others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled by the majority of mesa verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people the th century saw years of below average rainfall in the mesa verde region and after the area suffered from especially cold temperatures dendrochronology indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in there was a major decline in ceramic imports to the region during this time but local production remained steady despite challenging conditions the puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from to ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at mesa verde archeologists refer to this period as the great drought the last inhabitants of the mesa left the area c warfare edit oak tree house during the pueblo iii period to mesa verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures they often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas warfare was conducted using the same tools the mesa verdeans used for hunting game including bows and arrows stone axes and wooden clubs and spears they also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the th century civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought this system probably broke down during the great drought leading to intense warfare between competing clans increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century s final decades led to widespread conflict evidence of partly burned villages and post mortem trauma has been uncovered and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site wide massacre evidence of violence and cannibalism has been documented in the central mesa verde region c while most of the violence which peaked between and is generally ascribed to in fighting amongst mesa verdeans archeological evidence found at sand canyon pueblo in canyons of the ancients national monument suggests that violent interactions also occurred between mesa verdeans and people from outside the region evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the crow canyon archaeological center during the s the assaults which also occurred at the national monument s castle rock pueblo were dated to c and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of puebloan occupation at those sites many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe others were scalped dismembered and cannibalized the anthropophagy cannibalism might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation the archeological record indicates that rather than being isolated to the mesa verde region violent conflict was widespread in north america during the late th and early th centuries and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent migration edit the mesa verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the th century this might have driven emigration to mesa verde from less hospitable locations the added population stressed the mesa s environment further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought the region s bimodal precipitation pattern which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter began to fail post after there was a rapid depopulation of mesa verde as tens of thousands of people emigrated or died from starvation many smaller communities in the four corners region were also abandoned during this period the ancestral puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability but the depopulation of mesa verde at the end of the th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements while drought resource depletion and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of ancestral puebloan occupation their overdependence on maize crops is considered the fatal flaw of their subsistence strategy d the vacating mesa verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration but they left behind household goods including cooking utensils tools and clothing which gave archeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried an estimated people lived in the region during the th century but by the start of the th century the area was nearly uninhabited e many emigrants relocated to southern arizona and new mexico although the rate of settlement is unclear increases in sparsely populated areas such as rio chama pajarito plateau and santa fe correspond directly with the period of migration from mesa verde archeologists believe the mesa verdeans who settled in the areas near the rio grande where mesa verde black on white pottery became widespread during the th century were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders archeologists view this migration as a continuation versus a dissolution of ancestral puebloan society and culture many others relocated to the banks of the little colorado river in western new mexico and eastern arizona while archeologists tend to focus on the push factors that drove the mesa verdeans away from the region there were also several environmental pull factors such as warmer temperatures better farming conditions plentiful timber and bison herds which incentivized relocation to the area near the rio grande in addition to numerous settlements along the rio grande contemporary descendants of the mesa verdeans live in pueblos at acomo zuni jemez and laguna f organization edit although chaco canyon might have exerted regional control over mesa verde during the late th and early th centuries most archeologists view the mesa verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure several ancient roads averaging to feet to m wide and lined with earthen berms have been identified in the region most appear to connect communities and shrines others encircle great house sites the extent of the network is unclear but no roads have been discovered leading to the chacoan great north road or directly connecting mesa verde and chacoan sites ancestral puebloan shrines called herraduras have been identified near road segments in the region their purpose is unclear but several c shaped herraduras have been excavated and they are thought to have been directional shrines used to indicate the location of great houses g architecture edit section view of kiva a in mesa verde s fire temple cut from laser scan data collected by a cyark national park service partnership since fire temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures generally defined as kivas mesa verde is best known for a large number of well preserved cliff dwellings houses built in alcoves or rock overhangs along the canyon walls the structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone held together and plastered with adobe mortar specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls in marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas the cliff dwellings of mesa verde reflected a region wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close highly defensible quarters during the th century pueblo buildings were built with stone windows facing south and in u e and l shapes the buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts pottery became more versatile including pitchers ladles bowls jars and dishware for food and drink white pottery with black designs emerged the pigments coming from plants water management and conservation techniques including the use of reservoirs and silt retaining dams also emerged during this period styles for these sandstone mortar constructions both surface and cliff dwellings included t shaped windows and doors this has been taken by some archaeologists including stephen h lekson as evidence of the continuing reach of the chacoan system other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized puebloan style and or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system while much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common pueblo architectural forms including kivas towers and pit houses the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations mug house a typical cliff dwelling of the period was home to around people who shared small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could with no areas considered off limits to construction astronomy edit the sun temple at mesa verde mesa verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions which positioned windows doors and walls along the path of the sun whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons mesa verde s sun temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory the temple is d shaped and its alignment is degrees off true east west its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon it is aligned to the major lunar standstill which occurs once every years and the sunset during the winter solstice which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of cliff palace across fewkes canyon at the bottom of the canyon is the sun temple fire pit which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice sun temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the ancestral puebloans h agriculture and water control systems edit far view reservoir starting in the th century the farmers living in central mesa verde cultivated corn beans squash and gourds the combination of corn and beans provided the mesa verdeans with the amino acids of a complete protein when conditions were good or acres or ha of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year providing they supplemented with game and wild plants as mesa verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives the mesa tilts slightly to the south which increased its exposure to the sun before the introduction of pottery foods were baked roasted and parched hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region with the increased availability of ceramics after beans became much easier to cook this provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting it also aided corn cultivation as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in which likely increased corn yields the most mesa verdeans practiced dry farming which relied on rain to water their crops but others utilized runoff springs seeps and natural collection pools starting in the th century they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt some crops were watered by hand archeologists believe that prior to the th century springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources but as mesa verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community between and mesa verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms the morefield and box elder reservoirs soon afterward work began on two more the far view and sagebrush reservoirs which were approximately feet m across and constructed on the mesa top the reservoirs lie on an east west line that runs for approximately miles km which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system in the american society of civil engineers designated these four structures as national civil engineering historic landmarks a geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the far view reservoir this interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of chacoan culture hunting and foraging edit ancestral puebloan bone awls mesa verdeans typically harvested local small game but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances their main sources of animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits but they occasionally hunted bighorn sheep antelope and elk they began to domesticate turkeys starting around and by the th century consumption of the animal peaked supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites these domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn which further deepened reliance on the staple crop puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones despite the availability of fish in the area s rivers and streams archeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten mesa verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources depending on the season they collected pi√±on nuts and juniper berries weedy goosefoot pigweed purslane tomatillo tansy mustard globe mallow sunflower seeds and yucca as well as various species of grass and cacti prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge they used sagebrush and mountain mahogany along with pi√±on and juniper for firewood they also smoked wild tobacco because the ancestral puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred their midden piles were viewed with reverence starting during the basketmaker iii period c mesa verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds pottery edit mesa verde black on white mesa verde corrugated jars scholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the four corners region or introduced from the south specimens of shallow unfired clay bowls found at canyon de chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water which might represent the first fired pottery in the region an alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the mogollon rim area to the south where brown paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the common era others believe pottery was introduced to mesa verde from mexico c ce there is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region but archeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like ute mountain were more resilient and desirable and puebloans from throughout the region traded for them neutron activation analysis indicates that much of the black on white pottery found at mesa verde was produced locally cretaceous clays from both the dakota and menefee formations were used in black on white wares and mancos formation clays for corrugated jars i evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters or they might have shared a common source of raw materials the mesa verde black on white pottery was produced at three locations sand canyon castle rock and mesa verde archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood their sizes vary but the larger ones were up to feet m long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families designs were added to ceramic vessels with a yucca leaf brush and paints made from iron manganese beeplant and tansy mustard most of the pottery found in th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the th century many larger feast sized vessels were produced corrugated decorations appear on mesa verde grey wares after and by entire vessels were crafted in this way the technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular grey wares which were smooth by the th century these corrugated vessels which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones had largely replaced the older style whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than menefee which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors under normal conditions pots made of mancos shale turned grey when fired and those made of morrison formation clay turned white clays from southeastern utah turned red when fired in a high oxygen environment rock art and murals edit mesa verde s petroglyph point the glyphs represent top from right to left the eagle mountain sheep parrot horned toad and mountain lion clans and the ancestral puebloans bottom rock art is found throughout the mesa verde region but its dispersion is uneven and periodic some locations have numerous examples others have none and some periods saw prolific creation while others saw little styles also vary over time examples are relatively rare on mesa verde proper but abundant in the middle san juan river area which might indicate the river s importance as a travel route and key source of water common motifs in the rock art of the region include anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth handprints animal and people tracks wavy lines spirals concentric circles animals and hunting scenes as the region s population plummeted during the late th century the subject of mesa verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields warriors and battle scenes modern hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at mesa verde s petroglyph point as depictions of various clans of people starting during the late pueblo ii period and continuing through pueblo iii the ancestral puebloans of the mesa verde region created plaster murals in their great houses particularly in their kivas the murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals people and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as basketmaker iii c others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape the murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs the painted murals include the colors red green yellow white brown and blue the designs were still in use by the hopi during the th and th centuries anthropogenic ecology geography and climate edit anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem a shift from medium and large game animals such as deer bighorn sheep and antelope to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid th to mid th centuries might indicate that mesa verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa analysis of pack rat midden indicates that with the exception of invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past years mesa verde s canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area this resulted in mesa verde national park elevations ranging from about to feet to m the highest elevation at park point the terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the rocky mountains the region s precipitation pattern is bimodal meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer the climate is semi arid water for farming and consumption was provided by summer rains winter snowfall and seeps and springs in and near the mesa verde villages at feet m the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees cooler than the mesa top which reduced the amount of water needed for farming the cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy the angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings warm breezes blew from the valley and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than on the top of the mesa in the summer with the sun high overhead much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings geology edit although the area s first spanish explorers named the feature mesa verde the term is a misnomer as true mesas are almost perfectly flat because mesa verde is slanted to the south the proper geological term is cuesta not mesa the park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons mesa verde s slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area s cliff dwellings in the late cretaceous period the mancos shale was deposited on top of the dakota sandstone which is the rock formation that can be found under much of colorado the beds of the mancos shale are fine grained sand stones mudstones and shales which accumulated in the deep water of the cretaceous sea it has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain on top of this shale there are three formations in the mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time the first is the point lookout sandstone which is named for the point lookout feature in the park elevation feet this sandstone which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the cretaceous sea was receding is massive fine grained cross bedded and very resistant in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation its sediments are approximately feet thick and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates next is the menefee formation the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales siltstones and sandstones these were deposited in semi marine environments of brackish water such as swamps and lagoons due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition there are thin coal seams running through the menefee formation at the top this formation is intruded upon by the cliff house sandstone the cliff house sandstone is the area s youngest rock layer it was formed after the cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches dunes etc and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces like the point lookout sandstone it is about feet thick it contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells fish teeth and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea the shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the ancestral puebloans constructed their dwellings continuing through the cretaceous period and into the early tertiary there was uplifting in the area of the colorado plateau the san juan mountains and the la plata mountains which led to the formation of the mesa verde pediment with the help of erosion small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel later in the tertiary the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today this caused the isolation of the mesa verde pediment from surrounding rock today since the climate is more arid these erosional processes are slowed rediscovery edit spruce tree house mexican spanish missionaries and explorers francisco atanasio dom√≠nguez and silvestre v√©lez de escalante seeking a route from santa fe to california faithfully recorded their travels in they reached mesa verde green plateau region which they named after its high tree covered plateaus but they never got close enough or into the needed angle to see the ancient stone villages they were the first white men to travel the route through much of the colorado plateau into utah and back through arizona to new mexico the mesa verde region has long been occupied by the utes and an treaty between them and the united states government recognized ute ownership of all colorado land west of the continental divide after there had become an interest in land in western colorado a new treaty in left the ute with a strip of land in southwestern colorado between the border with new mexico and miles north most of mesa verde lies within this strip of land the ute wintered in the warm deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of mesa verde believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites they did not live in the ancient dwellings occasional trappers and prospectors visited with one prospector john moss making his observations known in the following year moss led eminent photographer william henry jackson through mancos canyon at the base of mesa verde there jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling geologist william h holmes retraced jackson s route in reports by both jackson and holmes were included in the report of the hayden survey one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the american west these and other publications led to proposals to systematically study southwestern

interior smithsonian institution ethnologist jesse walter fewkes described vandalism at mesa verde s cliff palace parties of curio seekers camped on the ruin for several winters and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals some of these objects are now in museums but many are forever lost to science in order to secure this

driven away from the area by hostile intruders in the early th century jesse walter fewkes theorized that climate change had adversely affected water supplies in the region which led to widespread crop failure and the rapid depopulation of the area the last two theories remain at the foreground of the archeological investigation of mesa verde contemporary native americans do not describe the region as abandoned but rather view it as a stage in the area s ongoing indigenous culture during this time the entirety of the zuni people are believed to have migrated to western new mexico
