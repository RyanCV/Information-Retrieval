southwestern united states near springdale utah a prominent feature of the square mile km park is zion canyon which is miles km long and up to half a mile m deep cut through the reddish and tan colored navajo sandstone by the north fork of the virgin river the lowest elevation is ft m at coalpits wash and the highest elevation is ft m at horse ranch mountain located at the junction of the colorado plateau great basin and mojave desert regions the park s unique geography and variety of life zones allow for unusual plant and animal diversity numerous plant species as well as species of birds mammals including species of bat and reptiles inhabit the park s four life zones desert riparian woodland and coniferous forest zion national park includes mountains canyons buttes mesas monoliths rivers slot canyons and natural arches human habitation of the area started about years ago with small family groups of native americans the semi nomadic basketmaker anasazi ce stem from one of these groups in turn the virgin anasazi culture ce developed as the basketmakers settled in permanent communities a different group the parowan fremont lived in the area as well both groups moved away by and were replaced by the parrusits and several other southern paiute subtribes mormons came into the area in and settled there in the early s in the president of the united states william howard taft named the area a national monument to protect the canyon under the name of mukuntuweap national monument in however the acting director of the newly created national park service changed the park s name to zion the name used by the mormons according to historian hal rothman the name change played to a prevalent bias of the time many believed that spanish and indian names would deter visitors who if they could not pronounce the name of a place might not bother to visit it the new name zion had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience the united states congress established the monument as a national park on november the kolob section was proclaimed a separate zion national monument in but was incorporated into the park in the geology of the zion and kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent million years of mostly mesozoic aged sedimentation at various periods in that time warm shallow seas streams ponds and lakes vast deserts and dry near

located on the markagunt and kolob plateaus at the intersection of three north american geographic provinces the colorado plateaus the great basin and the mojave desert the northern part of the park is known as the kolob canyons section and is accessible from interstate exit the foot m summit of horse ranch mountain photo is the highest point in the park the lowest point is the foot m elevation of coal pits wash creating a relief of about feet m streams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks the stream gradient of the virgin river whose north fork flows through zion canyon in the park ranges from to feet per mile to m km one of the steepest stream gradients in north america temples and towers of the virgin the road into zion canyon is miles km long ending at the temple of sinawava sinawava refers to the coyote god of the paiute indians at the temple the canyon narrows and a foot trail continues to the mouth of the zion narrows a gorge as narrow as feet m wide and up to feet m tall the zion canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early april to late october and by private vehicles the other months of the year other roads in zion are open to private vehicles year round the east side of the park is served by zion mount carmel highway which passes through the zion mount carmel tunnel and ends at mount carmel junction utah on the east side of the park notable park features include checkerboard mesa photo and the east temple the kolob terrace area west of zion canyon features the subway a slot canyon hike and lava point

archaeologists have divided the long span of zion s human history into three cultural periods the archaic protohistoric and historic periods each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations archaic period edit the first human presence in the region dates to years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds about years ago some groups began growing corn and other crops leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos archaeologists call this the archaic period and it lasted until about ce baskets cordage nets and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period the archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives drills and stemmed dart points the dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls by ce some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic anasazi the basketmakers basketmaker sites have grass or stone lined storage cists and shallow partially underground dwellings called pithouses they were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade protohistoric period edit kaun huts were used by southern paiute both the virgin anasazi and the parowan fremont disappear from the archaeological record of southwestern utah by about extended droughts in the th and th centuries interspersed with catastrophic flooding may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region tradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were numic speaking cousins of the virgin anasazi such as the southern paiute and ute the newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals some particularly the southern paiute also planted fields of corn sunflowers and squash to supplement their diet these more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking exploration and settlement by euro americans edit the historic period begins in the late th century with the exploration of southern utah by padres silvestre vélez de escalante and francisco atanasio domínguez the padres passed near what is now the kolob canyons visitor center on october becoming the first people of european descent known to visit the area in trapper and trader jedediah smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the american fur company in mormon farmers from the salt lake area became the first people of european descent to settle the virgin river region in the parowan and cedar city utah areas were settled by mormons who used the kolob canyons area for timber and for grazing cattle sheep and horses they prospected for mineral deposits and diverted kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below mormon settlers named the area kolob in mormon scripture the heavenly place nearest the residence of god a ranch located near the mouth of zion canyon settlements had expanded miles km south to the lower virgin river by that year a southern paiute guide led young mormon missionary and interpreter nephi johnson into the upper virgin river area and zion canyon johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper virgin river basin and returned later that year to found the town of virgin in or joseph black made the arduous journey to zion canyon and was very impressed by its beauty the floor of zion canyon was settled in by isaac behunin who farmed corn tobacco and fruit trees the behunin family lived in zion canyon near the site of today s zion lodge during the summer and wintered in springdale behunin is credited with naming zion a reference to a place of peace mentioned in the bible two more families settled zion canyon in the next couple of years bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals the canyon floor was farmed until zion became a monument in the powell geographic expedition entered the area in after their first trip through the grand canyon john wesley powell visited zion canyon in and named it mukuntuweap under the impression that that was the paiute name powell survey photographers john k hillers and james fennemore first visited the zion canyon and kolob plateau region in the spring of hillers returned in april to add more photographs to the virgin river series of photographs and stereographs hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs protection and tourism edit painting of zion canyon by frederick dellenbaugh paintings of the canyon by frederick s dellenbaugh were exhibited at the saint louis world s fair in followed by a glowing article in scribner s magazine the next year that along with previously created photographs paintings and reports led to president william howard taft s proclamation on july that created mukuntuweap national monument in the acting director of the newly created national park service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular mukuntuweap to zion a name used by the local mormon community the united states congress added more land and established zion national park on november a separate zion national monument the kolob canyons area was proclaimed on january and was incorporated into the park on july travel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location lack of accommodations and the absence of real roads in southern utah old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about and the road into zion canyon was built in leading to the grotto short of the present road that now ends at the temple of sinawava poster of zion national park touring cars could reach zion canyon by the summer of the first visitor lodging in zion canyon called wylie camp was established that same year as a tent camp the utah parks company a subsidiary of the union pacific railroad acquired wylie camp in and offered ten day rail bus tours to zion nearby bryce canyon kaibab and the north rim of the grand canyon the zion lodge complex was built in at the site of the wylie tent camp architect gilbert stanley underwood designed the zion lodge photo in the rustic style and the utah parks company funded the construction infrastructure improvements edit main article historical buildings and structures of zion national park work on the zion mount carmel highway started in to enable reliable access between springdale and the east side of the park the road opened in and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased the most famous feature of the zion mount carmel highway is the mile km zion mt carmel tunnel which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff in local rancher john winder improved the native american footpath up echo canyon which later became the east rim trail entrepreneur david flanigan used this trail in to build cableworks that lowered lumber into zion canyon from cable mountain more than board feet m of lumber were lowered by the auto road was extended to the temple of sinawava and a trail built from there mile km to the start of the narrows angel s landing trail was constructed in and two suspension bridges were built over the virgin river other trails were constructed by the civilian conservation corps during the s more recent history edit zion canyon from the trail to observation point zion canyon scenic drive provides access to zion canyon traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the s and a public transportation system using propane powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year as part of its shuttle fleet zion has two electric trams each holding up to passengers usually from early april through late october the scenic drive in zion canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses on april heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the virgin river in zion canyon over a period of two hours the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon trapping guests and employees at the zion lodge a one lane temporary road was constructed within hours to allow evacuation of the lodge a more stable albeit temporary road was completed on may to allow summer visitors to access the canyon this road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of the zion mount carmel highway can be travelled year round access for over sized vehicles requires a special permit and is limited to daytime hours as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles the mile km long kolob canyons road was built to provide access to the kolob canyons section of the park this road often closes in the winter in march president barack obama signed into law the omnibus public land management act of which designated and further protected acres ha of park land as the zion wilderness in september flooding trapped a party of seven in keyhole canyon a slot canyon in the park the flash flood killed all seven members of the group whose remains were located after a search lasting several days virgin river after a snowstorm geology edit main article geology of the zion and kolob canyons area the three patriarchs in zion canyon are made of navajo sandstone the nine known exposed geologic formations in zion national park are part of a super sequence of rock units called the grand staircase together these formations represent about million years of mostly mesozoic aged sedimentation in that part of north america the formations exposed in the zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments the warm shallow sometimes advancing or retreating sea of the kaibab and moenkopi formations streams ponds and lakes of the chinle moenave and kayenta formations the vast desert of the navajo and temple cap formations and the dry near shore environment of the carmel formation the kolob canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the kolob plateau uplift affected the entire region known as the colorado plateaus by slowly raising these formations more than feet m higher than where they were deposited this steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral virgin and other rivers on the plateau the faster moving streams took advantage of uplift created joints in the rocks eventually all cenozoic aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus zion canyon was cut by the north fork of the virgin river in this way during the later part of this process lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area high water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon these flood events are responsible for transporting most of the million short tons million metric tons of rock and sediment that the virgin river transports yearly the virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the virgin the valley between the peaks of the twin brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon table of formations exposed in zion national park rock layer appearance location deposition rock type photo dakota formation

coniferous forest habitats are all visible the great basin mojave desert and colorado plateau converge at zion and the kolob canyons this along with the varied topography of canyon mesa country differing soil types and uneven water availability provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area the park is home to bird mammals reptiles fish and amphibian species these organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park desert riparian woodland and coniferous forest desert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams sagebrush prickly pear cactus and rabbitbrush along with sacred datura and indian paintbrush are common utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found

trails with round trip times of half an hour weeping rock to hours angels landing are found in zion canyon two popular trails taylor creek hours round trip and kolob arch hours round trip are in the kolob canyons section of the park near cedar city hiking up into the narrows from the temple of sinawava is popular in summer however hiking beyond big springs requires a permit the entire narrows from chamberlain s ranch is a mile one way trip that typically takes hours of strenuous hiking a shorter alternative is to enter the narrows via orderville canyon both orderville and the full narrows require a back country permit entrance to the parunuweap canyon section of the park downstream of labyrinth falls is prohibited other often used backcountry trails include the west rim and laverkin creek the more primitive sections of zion include the kolob terrace and the kolob canyons the final ascent at the top of the angels landing trail zion is a center for rock climbing with short walls like touchstone moonlight buttress spaceshot and prodigal son being very popular camping and lodging lodging in the park is available at zion lodge located halfway through zion canyon zion lodge is open year round and has motel units and cabins as well as a restaurant café and gift shop but rooms fill up fast three campgrounds are available south and watchman at the far southern side of the park and a primitive site at lava point in the middle of the park off kolob terrace road watchman is the only campground in the park that takes reservations lava point has only primitive facilities and is usually open from june to october overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits nearby attractions and amenities zion canyon imax in springdale offers many interesting documentaries about the natural history of zion canyon and the american southwest lodging food and entertainment are also offered on the east side of the park along the zion mount carmel highway and in mount carmel junction adjacent to the park on the south is the town of springdale utah which offers services such as lodging food and entertainment driving through the east side of zion to u s route allows access to bryce
