w area acres ha established may visitors in governing body national park service crater lake national park is a united states national park located in southern oregon established in crater lake national park is the fifth oldest national park in the united states and the only national park in oregon the park encompasses the caldera of crater lake a remnant of a destroyed volcano mount mazama and the surrounding hills and forests the lake is feet m deep at its deepest point which makes it the deepest lake in the united states the second deepest in north america and the ninth deepest in the world crater lake is often referred to as the seventh deepest lake in the world but this former listing excludes the approximately foot m depth of subglacial lake vostok in antarctica which resides under nearly feet m of ice and the recent report of a foot m maximum depth for lake o higgins san martin located on the border of chile and argentina however when comparing its average depth of feet m to the average depth of other deep lakes crater lake becomes the deepest in the western hemisphere and the third deepest in the world the impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical foot m deep caldera formed years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of mount mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the cascade range the caldera rim ranges in elevation from to feet to m the united states geological survey benchmarked elevation of the lake surface itself is feet m this national park encompasses acres ha sq mi crater lake has no streams flowing into or out of it all water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage the lake s water commonly has a striking blue hue and the lake is re filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain contents geology climate fauna park features history activities trails cleetwood cove the watchman

relief map of the crater lake area volcanic activity in this area is fed by subduction off the coast of oregon as the juan de fuca plate slips below the north american plate see plate tectonics heat and compression generated by this movement has created a mountain chain topped by a series of volcanoes which together are called the cascade range the large volcanoes in the range are called the high cascades however there are many other volcanoes in the range as well most of which are much smaller about years ago mount mazama began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the high cascades as overlapping shield volcanoes over time alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic flows built mazama s overlapping cones until it reached about feet m in height as the young stratovolcano grew many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park s borders chief among these were cinder cones although the early examples are gone cinder cones erode easily there are at least much younger cinder cones in the park and at least another or so outside its borders that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance there continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to mazama s magma chamber and system or if they were related to background oregon cascade volcanism after a period of dormancy mazama became active again then around bc mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous volcanic eruption losing to feet to m in height the eruption formed a large caldera that depending on the prevailing climate was filled in about years forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue known today as crater lake the eruptive period that decapitated mazama also laid waste to much of the greater crater lake area and deposited ash as far east as the northwest corner of what is now yellowstone national park as far south as central nevada and as far north as southern british columbia it produced more than times as much ash as the may eruption of mount st helens this ash has since developed a soil type called andisol soils in crater lake national park are brown dark brown or dark grayish brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles gravel and stones they are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive climate edit november panoroma from rim village during the winter the road up to rim village is normally plowed but rim drive is closed snow is relatively rare at low elevations in western oregon but it is common at higher elevations especially at crater lake measurements at park headquarters feet m above sea level show that snow falls more often here than at any other long term weather station in oregon winter which typically begins at the park in september and runs through june includes an average of days with measurable snowfall up to inches cm of snow have fallen on the park in a single day in and inches cm in a month january and inches cm in a year snow typically accumulates in the park to depths of to feet to m by early spring most of the park s roads remain closed through late spring and snow lingers into the summer in july and august snowfall is uncommon and one magnificent day typically follows another january is the coldest month when highs average about f c and lows average about f c august is the warmest month with an average high of roughly f c and an average low of about f c between and the highest recorded temperature was f c and the lowest was f c annual precipitation averages about inches mm a year december is the wettest averaging about inches mm although snow covers crater lake national park for eight months of the year average annual snowfall is in cm the lake rarely freezes over due in part to a relatively mild onshore flow from the pacific ocean the last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in a very long cold winter a surface freeze occurred in the immense depth of crater lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight maintaining the lake temperature at an average of f c on the surface and f c at the bottom

residents of this national park are canadian lynxes bobcats beavers chipmunks pikas foxes cougars squirrels porcupines black bears brown bears coyotes wolves badgers deer elk muskrats and martens birds that commonly fly through this park including raptors are american dippers peregrine falcons ravens clark s nutcrackers gray jays bald eagles hummingbirds and spotted owls while canada geese float on its lake park features edit comfort station number the pinnacles some notable park features created by this huge eruption are the pumice desert a very thick layer of pumice and ash leading away from mazama in a northerly direction even after thousands of years this area is largely devoid of plants due to excessive porosity meaning water drains through quickly and poor soil composed primarily of regolith the pinnacles when the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano it formed to foot to m thick gas charged deposits for perhaps years afterward hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through fumaroles erosion later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice leaving tall pinnacles and spires other park features mount scott is a steep andesitic cone whose lava came from magma from mazama s magma chamber geologists call such volcano a parasitic or satellite cone volcanic eruptions apparently ceased on scott sometime before the end of the pleistocene one remaining large cirque on scott s northwest side was left unmodified by post ice age volcanism in the southwest corner of the park stands union peak an extinct volcano whose primary remains consist of a large volcanic plug which is lava that solidified in the volcano s neck crater peak is a shield volcano primarily made of andesite and basalt lava flows topped by andesitic and dacite tephra timber crater is a shield volcano located in the northeast corner of the park like crater peak it is made of basaltic and andesitic lava flows but unlike crater it is topped by two cinder cones rim drive is the most popular road in the park it follows a scenic route around the caldera rim llao rock on the north side rises feet m above the lake with a mile km trail from rim drive leading to the summit the pacific crest trail a mile km long distance hiking and equestrian trail that stretches from the mexican to canadian borders passes through the park old growth forests covering acres ha degree panoramic photograph of crater lake from the top of nearby mount scott looking west two snow covered peaks can be seen in the distance to the right of the lake is mount thielsen and in the far left of the photo is mount mcloughlin history edit aerial view of crater lake local native americans witnessed the collapse of mount mazama and kept the event alive in their legends one ancient legend of the klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today s scientific research the legend tells of two chiefs llao of the below world and skell of the above world pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of llao s home mt mazama the battle was witnessed in the eruption of mt mazama and the creation of crater lake a trio of gold prospectors john wesley hillman henry klippel and isaac skeeters were the first whites to visit the lake on june they stumbled upon the long sloping mountain while hunting for provisions stunned by vibrant blue color of the lake they named the indigo body of water deep blue lake and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as discovery point but gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten the suggested name later fell out of favor by locals who preferred the name crater lake william gladstone steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at crater lake his preoccupation with the lake began in in his efforts to bring recognition to the park he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support he named many of the lake s landmarks including wizard island llao rock and skell head with the help of geologist clarence dutton steel organized a usgs expedition to study the lake in the party carried the cleetwood a half ton survey boat up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake from the stern of the cleetwood a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at different points their deepest sounding feet m was very close to the modern official depth of feet m made in by sonar at the same time a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the crater lake area crater lake lodge partly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from steel and others crater lake national park was established may by president theodore roosevelt and because of steel s involvement crater lake lodge was opened in and the rim drive was completed in highways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism the edition of o ranger described access and facilities available by then crater lake national park is reached by train on the southern pacific railroad lines into medford and klamath falls at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park a hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations for the motorist the visit to the park is a short side trip from the pacific and dalles california highways he will find in addition to the hotel campsites stores filling stations the park is open to travel from late june or july for as long as snow does not block the roads generally until october the lake is described in the poetry of joaquin miller activities edit daily trips there are many hiking trails inside the park and several campgrounds unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size species or number the lake is believed to have no indigenous fish but several species of fish were introduced beginning in until all fish stocking ended in kokanee salmon oncorhynchus nerka and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss now thrive and reproduce here naturally swimming is allowed in the lake and the boat tours which stop at wizard island a cinder cone inside the lake operate daily during the summer all lake access for people is from cleetwood trail a steep walking trail and there are no roads for cars trucks or wagons that lead to the waterfront all of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter numerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the rim drive which is miles km long and has an elevation gain of feet m the highest point in crater lake national park is mount scott at feet m getting there requires a fairly steep mile km hike from the rim drive trailhead on a clear day visibility from the summit exceeds miles km and one can in a single view take in the entire caldera also visible from this point are the white peaked cascade range volcanoes to the north the columbia river plateau to the east and also the western cascades and the more distant klamath mountains to the west the scenery of crater lake is fully accessible during the summer months heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall winter and spring months force many road and trail closures including the popular rim drive which is generally completely open from july to october and partially open in some other months such as may june and november trails edit view up to watchman trail and peak garfield peak trail view east towards crater lake cleetwood cove edit the cleetwood cove trail is one of the several walk trails that originate from the rim drive it drops feet m from the cleetwood cove parking lot first opened during the summer of it is the only trail that accesses directly to the lake the trail is a little over a mile with easy slopes downhill that may make the grade climb out mildly strenuous the trail accesses the boat dock and a rock from which diving jumping to the lake is common concessionaire tour boats provide tours around the lake or drop off points at wizard island benches along the trail allow for an easier climb out several points along the trail offer lake views the trail is not wheelchair accessible and may be restricted to visitors with mobility impairments the watchman edit the watchman trail begins from the watchman overlook parking lot built in the s the trail is miles km long and feet m vertical it is a steady uphill trail on an isolated mountain on the west rim of the crater with several switchbacks providing some of the more breathtaking views of crater lake and wizard lake other neighboring landmarks are visible at the top of the trail including mount mcloughlin mount thielsen union peak mount scott and the klamath basin the trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in similar to the one atop mount scott on the opposite side of the crater lightning spring edit the lightning spring trail starts from the lightning spring picnic area it is a mile km hike with an elevation gain of feet m the trail circles around several meadows up to the lightning spring creek the trail is known for the frequent sights of grazing deer castle crest wildflower garden edit this is considered to be the easiest trail looping around the castle crest wildflower garden it starts from the east rim road near the park s headquarters it received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with wildflowers in the springtime the trail is about mile m before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden from which other improvised routes depart plaikni falls edit the plaikni falls trail is the newest trail on the crater lake park it stretches miles km from the trailhead located miles km south from the phantom ship overlook on pinnacles road which spins off rim drive the trail leads to the plaikni falls most of the trail is wheelchair accessible the final stretch is fairly uphill which may prove moderately challenging garfield peak edit phantom ship the garfield peak trail is a moderately challenging mile km hike to garfield summit the trailhead is located east of the crater lake lodge and gains approximately feet m of elevation several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the phantom ship island and dutton cliff a few viewpoints offer unique views of wizard island the trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors
