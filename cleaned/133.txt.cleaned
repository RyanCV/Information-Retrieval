enhancement request faq search search form search blackboard spellcheck feature turned on the spellcheck function in blackboard was turned on in our system wednesday april 20 2016 and is now available in textboxes within blackboard course sites this was done after spending much time consulting with the vendor testing and applying their fixes for this issue to our system please note that at this time the spellcheck function only works as designed in firefox or chrome where it underlines the misspelled word in red and offers suggestions for correction when right clicking on the word however in internet explorer the functionality only partially works by underlining the misspelled word but does not offer suggestions for correction while blackboard is working to correct this issue we wanted to get spellcheck turned back on as soon as possible for campus as we get closer to finals while we don t anticipate any issues with this tool or with the overall system now that spellcheck has been re enabled in blackboard please let us know if you experience any blackboard performance issues you can contact the ku it educational technology team at blackboardsupport ku edu or 785 864 2600 during
