attractions access see also references external links human history edit paleoindians and native americans edit human history in the region now part of north cascades national park dates back to the end of the last glacial period and the region has been continuously inhabited for at least the last years at that time native american ancestors of skagit tribes slowly advanced from puget sound into the interior mountainous region as the glacial ice retreated archeological evidence of continuous human presence in the north cascades dates to b p and rocks procured from sources in the region were used to manufacture stone tools and weapons for several millennia hozomeen chert a type of rock well suited to the fabrication of implements was mined from near hozomeen mountain just east of the park border for the last years hozomeen chert is part of the archeological record throughout the skagit river valley west of the park and in regions to the east indicating people visited the region if for no other purpose than to obtain raw materials prehistoric micro blades dating back to years before present have been discovered at cascade pass a mountain pass that connects the western lowlands to the interior regions of the park and the stehekin river valley the micro blades are part of an archeological assemblage that includes five distinct cultural periods indicating that people were traveling into the mountains nearly years ago the archeological excavation at cascade pass is one of the prehistoric sites that have been identified in the park microflakes excavated from cascades pass the two on the right were crafted from quartz when white explorers first entered the area in the late th century perhaps skagits lived there the skagits lived in settlements culling their needs from the waterways and traveling by way of canoe skagits formed a loose confederation of tribes that united if threatened by outside tribes such as the haidas who lived to the north they erected large houses or lodges that might house multiple families each with their own partioned area and entrance the lodges were feet m in length and to ft to m in width and the roofs were shed styles with a single pitch structures built by other puget sound tribes usually had gable roofs with more than one pitch the skagits were generally lowlanders who only ventured into the north cascades during the summer months and structures in the mountains were more modest consisting mostly of temporary buildings erected with poles and covered with branches the skagits erected totem poles and participated in potlatch ceremonies similar to the haidas but with less complexity and extravagance by only about skagits remained in the region but their numbers have since rebounded some nlaka pamux in inland and residing to the north and east of the skagits the nlaka pamux or thompson indians and named after explorer david thompson chelan okanogan and wenatchi tribes lived partly or year round in the eastern sections of the north cascades the skagits and thompsons often had disputes and raided each other s camps in search of slaves or to exact retributions like the coastal based skagits inland tribes also constructed long lodges which were occupied by numerous families though the style of construction was slightly different as the lodges did not have partitions separating one family from another and were frame constructed and covered with reed mats rather than from cedar planking one wenatchi lodge was described by thompson as being ft m long inland tribes were more likely to travel on foot or horseback than by canoe since the inland regions were less densely forested inland tribes also had less bountiful fisheries and greater weather extremes due to being further away from the moderating influence of the pacific ocean additionally inland tribes rarely erected totem poles or participated in potlatch ceremonies by the beginning of the th century inland tribes like their coastal neighbors had much reduced populations from when they had first encountered white explorers a hundred years earlier mostly due to smallpox and other diseases modern exploration edit the earliest white explorer to enter the north cascades was most likely a scotsman named alexander ross in who was in the employ of the pacific fur company an american owned company to the southeast of the modern park boundary ross and other members of the company constructed fort okanogan in as a base to operate from during the early period of the pacific northwest fur trade fort okanogon was the first american settlement in present day washington and well north of the route followed by members of the lewis and clark expedition of and also north of fort vancouver which was on the columbia river fort okanogon was later owned by the north west company and then the hudson s bay company both of which were british owned much of the trade in furs was conducted between native american and a few white trappers at trading posts staffed by representatives of the fur trading company in one season alone ross traded for beaver pelts in ross became the first known white explorer to cross the major peaks of the north cascades but he was less interested in exploration than in simply attempting to discover a route which would easily connect the fur posts of interior washington with puget sound to the west ross was accompanied by three indians one of which was a guide who led the party to a high pass in the north cascades ross and the guide may have travelled as far west as the skagit river but failed to get to puget sound fur trading slowed considerably as demand for furs decreased in the s but a few residents continued to at least augment their income by trapping for furs in the future park until when the park was established rendering the activity illegal aside from isolated trappers the north cascades saw no explorations until the s in u s army captain george b mcclellan led a party that explored for potential places that a railroad could be built through the region mcclellan determined that the mountains were too numerous and precipitous and that any railway would have to be constructed well south of the current park american and british disputes in the region centered on the fur trade and the treaty of allowed for joint administration of oregon country as it was referred to in the u s the british empire referred to the region as the columbia district the treaty set the international boundary at the th parallel but this was not as clear west of the rocky mountains since the rival fur trading outfits had their own ideas about where the boundary should be the oregon boundary dispute between britain and the u s eventually led to the oregon treaty of and the th parallel forms both the current international boundary as well as the northern border of the current park during the late s members of the u s north west boundary commission explored the boundary region attempting to identify which mountains rivers and lakes belonged to which country one party of the commission was led by explorer henry custer and they explored much of the northern district of the park publishing their report in the s custer s party crossed whatcom pass in and were the first whites to see challenger glacier and hozomeen mountain so impressed with the scenic grandeur of the region custer succinctly stated must be seen it cannot be described during the explorations by custer gold was discovered in a quartz vein on the slopes of eldorado peak in u s army lt henry hubbard pierce led a government sponsored exploration that traversed along the western boundary of the southern section of the current park in search of transportation routes and natural resources as had been true for the party led by mcclellan in the s pierce failed to find a suitable route for a railway and only marginally suitable routes for roads further expeditions by the military in and also determined that the mountains were virtually impenetrable explorers continued to seek out routes for wagon roads and railways and by the end of the th century much of the park had been explored but it wasn t until that the north cascades highway finally bisected the mountains mining logging and dam construction edit prospectors had entered the north cascades by the s placer mining first started along the banks of the skagit river in the s placer mining also commenced along ruby creek and hundreds of miners flocked to the region even though it was difficult to access most mining activity along ruby creek had ended by the s but was soon replaced by hard rock mining for silver and other minerals this second period of mining lasted from the s to the s but was only marginally more lucrative miners were hampered by short working seasons difficult terrain low quantities of ore and a lack of financial investments miners built many of the first trails and roads into portions of the backcountry some that involved intricate engineering including bridges over the numerous streams and dynamiting rock ledges above steep gorges during trail construction one mining company built a series of flumes the longest of which was over miles km to both transport lumber and to supply water for use in their hydraulic mining operation during the latter years of the th century and the first half of the th century larger scale mining companies mined silver and lead in addition to gold mostly for little to no profitability the demand for various metals was not constant so prices tended to fluctuate too much for mining to be viable once the region became a national park some privately owned mining inholdings remained one such inholding the thunder creek mine was still privately owned as of unlike many other regions of the pacific northwest logging had little major impact on the future park the ruggedness of the terrain and the existence of more economically viable timber resources which were closer to transportation routes largely dissuaded the timber industry from logging in the area in the washington forest reserve was set aside essentially preserving the forestland that would later become the park by the management of the reserve was transferred from the u s department of the interior to the u s department of agriculture and the u s forest service was subsequently created to administer these forest reserves nationwide which were redesignated as national forests though the department of agriculture allowed commercial enterprises the right to log the forest with a permit most of the timber taken from the region was used only locally for the construction of cabins and similar small scale enterprises logging expanded when the skagit river hydroelectric project was commenced by the public utility seattle city light in the s almost acres ha of timber would have been left underwater by the completion of the ross dam a contract to extract the timber was awarded in and the project was not completed until none of the dams or areas that were extensively logged are within the current boundaries of the national park but they are in the adjoining ross lake national recreation area establishing the national park edit the establishment of yellowstone national park in and yosemite national park in led preservationists to argue for similar protections for other areas in the u s even before the north cascade region was provided some protection when it was designated a forest reserve in activists argued that the region should be afforded the greater protection accorded from a national park designation a petition was submitted in by washington state citizens to establish a national park to the north of lake chelan as many who had visited the region believed it to have scenery greater than switzerland s further efforts surfaced in and again in the years between and when several bills to designate the region a national park failed to get ratification from the u s congress not all locals supported the idea of a national park as they felt that such a designation would negatively impact their economic situation the u s forest service was also not in favor of a park as that would mean they would have to relinquish control over the land an event that was not uncommon since many parks that were being established were originally managed by the forest service in an effort to appease their detractors the u s forest service designated primitive areas which would provide increased protections to some of the most pristine regions they managed by the mid s forester bob marshall argued that the region should be set aside as wilderness as that would keep the national park service out since their mandate would force them to construct roads and build improvements for the sake of tourism rival interests continued to argue over whether the lands should remain under the management of the u s forest service or the national park service but by the s the environmentalist argument advocating for a national park prevailed though the north cascades national park act designated the region as a national park on october the national park service did not commence direct management until january the north cascades national park act also designated ross lake and lake chelan national recreation areas redwood national park in california was also signed into existence on the same day as the north cascades by much of bob marshall s original plan to set aside the future park as wilderness was achieved when percent of north cascades national park was designated as the stephen mather wilderness park management edit mount triumph north cascades national park is managed by the national park service and the park headquarters is in sedro woolley washington the park consists of a northern and a southern district or unit these are separated by ross lake national recreation area the southeast boundary of the southern district abuts lake chelan national recreation area the park and two recreation areas are managed as the north cascades national park complex the three entities were all established in and in much of the park complex was designated wilderness as the stephen mather wilderness preventing further non natural alterations to percent of the park the mandate of the national park service is to preserve and protect natural and cultural resources the organic act of august established the national park service as a federal agency one major section of the act has often been summarized as the mission to promote and regulate the use of the national parks which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations in keeping with this mandate hunting is illegal in the park as is mining logging and removal of natural or cultural resources additionally oil and gas exploration and extraction are not permitted in north cascades national park recorded over visitors but adjoining ross lake national recreation area reported over visitors and lake chelan national recreation area had just under visitors peak visitation is between the months of june and september the vast majority of visitors come to ross lake national recreation area which is easily accessible on washington state route also known as the north cascades highway and the only road which bisects the park complex north cascades national park complex had an operating base budget of for fiscal year augmented by another of non base funding which can fluctuate significantly from year to year and additional funding from revenue generated from concessionaire contracts and user fees much of the budget is for staffing with percent directed to pay for the employ of permanent employees not all of which are employed year round and the nearly seasonal and term employees that work primarily in the summer months the north cascades national park complex management activities include facilities management which oversees the maintenance and construction of roads miles km of trails and buildings and resource management which is involved in areas as diverse as fire management biological resource management and glacier monitoring park employees also provide law enforcement search and rescue medical response interpretive services and educational outreach and the administrative division which oversees budgets personnel and contracting services geography edit map of the north cascades national park complex main article geography of the north cascades north cascades national park is located in portions of whatcom skagit and chelan counties in the u s state of washington bisected by ross lake national recreation area the park consists of two districts the northern and southern the northern boundary of the north district is also the international border between the u s and canada the latter manages adjoining skagit valley provincial park the entire eastern and southern boundary of the north district is bordered by ross lake nra the western side of the north district is bordered by mount baker snoqualmie national forest within which lies the mount baker and noisy diobsud wildernesses both of which border the park mount baker snoqualmie national forest also borders a portion of the southern district of north cascades national park to the southwest also along the southwest border lies wenatchee national forest within which lies the glacier peak wilderness the southern boundary of the park is shared with lake chelan nra while a small section of the eastern boundary is shared with okanogan national forest the lake chelan sawtooth wilderness lies in wenatchee and okanogan national forests along the southeastern park boundary north cascades national park has nearly feet m of vertical relief with a park high point atop goode mountain and the western valleys situated at only around ft m above mean sea level the park has a highly varied ecosystem including eight life zones erosion from water and glacial ice have made the mountain peaks of the north cascades some of the steepest mountain ranges in the contiguous u s rising between and ft and m above their bases north cascades national park is home to over glaciers as well as lakes and is the headwaters for the skagit stehekin and nooksack rivers the ruggedness of the terrain has been an obstacle to urbanization and consequently north cascades national park is almost entirely wilderness though it is but miles km from seattle tacoma international airport in seattle washington north cascades geology edit named after the mountain peaks that are the central feature of the region the north cascades are a subsection of the cascade range which extends from northern california to british columbia canada the north cascades are the northern section of the cascade range and unlike their southern counterparts which consist mostly of tertiary to holocene volcanic rocks the north cascades are composed primarily of mesozoic crystalline and metamorphic rocks the exposed rocks which are found in north cascades national park predate the middle devonian and are approximately million years old much harder and more durable than the newer volcanic rocks of the southern cascades the north cascades are consequently more rugged with steep terrain being the norm due to heavy erosion from water and ice apparently still rising the north cascades originally formed from the jumbled masses of various rock structures that had their origination point thousands of miles to the south some million years ago by million years ago the heavier basaltic rocks of the ocean floor had started to push the lighter granitic rocks that are the core of the park s mountains upward a process that is ongoing continued rising in conjunction with erosion from water and ice has created deep valleys and consequently the vertical relief is significant averaging between and ft and m which is comparable to much taller mountain ranges mountains edit mount terror left skyline inspiration peak center and mcmillan spires right center from the south are peaks found in the picket range the tallest mountain in north cascades national park is goode mountain at ft m goode mountain is in a remote backcountry region of the southern section of the park near goode mountain are several other peaks that exceed ft m including buckner mountain ft m and mount logan ft m just under feet about miles km northeast of goode mountain is black peak ft m other prominent peaks in the southern section of the park include boston peak ft m eldorado peak ft m and forbidden peak ft m the northern region of the park contains the picket range a subrange of the skagit range which is in turn a subrange of the north cascades the picket range has numerous spires with ominous names such as mount fury mount challenger poltergeist pinnacle mount terror ghost peak and phantom peak all of which exceed ft m the picket range is only mi km long yet contains peaks over ft m north of the picket range and near the border with canada lie mount redoubt ft m mount spickard ft m and the spires of the mox peaks ft m isolated and dominating the northwestern reaches of the park lies the oft photographed mount shuksan ft m which towers more than ft m above baker lake only mi km to the south water features edit lakes and ponds are located within north cascades national park complex glaciers edit aerial photograph of neve glacier in with approximately glaciers north cascades national park has the most glaciers of any u s park outside alaska and a third of all the glaciers in the lower states are located in the park counting a few glaciers in the adjoining national recreation areas the north cascades national park complex glaciers covered an expanse totalling acres km as of the dense concentration and relative ease of access to the north cascade glaciers brought about some of the earliest scientific series of studies regarding glaciology in the u s beginning in the university of washington sponsored richard c hubley to undertake annual aerial photography expeditions designed to capture images of the glaciers and to show any alterations that might be occurring in austin post expanded the aerial coverage to include other regions and he also used ground based imagery to augment the research in based on the photographic imagery and other data collected since post and others wrote a groundbreaking report that documented the number and scale of glaciers in the north cascades at the time of austin post s inventory their study concluded that some north cascades glaciers had experienced a period of minor growth or equilibrium in the mid th century after undergoing decades of retreat the study concluded that annual glacial melt due to seasonal variations has a significant influence on river levels accounting for about percent of the late summer water flow which directly impacted the supported ecosystems such as salmon fisheries lower curtis glacier in compared to extent demarcated by red line demonstrates the retreat of this glacier the national park service nps united states geological survey usgs and private researchers such as mauri s pelto who has led the north cascades glacier climate project since have continued research on north cascade glaciers since the nps has conducted rigorous studies on four park glaciers noisy creek silver north klawatti and sandalee glaciers the nps research indicated that these four glaciers experienced rapid decrease in volumes between and in a nps and portland state university aerial photographic inventory showed a percent loss in parkwide glacial volume since austin post s inventory in the nps states that in the last years since the end of the little ice age a period of several centuries in which the earth experienced a cooling phase glacial ice volumes in the north cascades have been reduced by percent this loss of glacial ice has contributed to decreased melt in the summer and in just the thunder creek watershed alone this decreased runoff amounts to a loss of percent of the summer streamflow boston glacier on the north slope of boston peak is the largest glacier in the park measured in to have an area of acres km other large glaciers include east nooksack and sulphide glaciers on mount shuksan mcallister and inspiration glaciers on eldorado peak redoubt glacier on mount redoubt neve glacier on snowfield peak and challenger glacier on mount challenger ecology edit the thornton lakes fill glacier carved basins near mount triumph main article ecology of the north cascades variation in rock and soil types exposure slope elevation and rainfall is reflected in the diverse plant life eight distinctive life zones support thousands of different plant species in the north cascades greater ecosystem flora edit no other national park surpasses north cascades national park s over vascular plant species recorded estimates of non vascular and fungal species could more than double the number of plant species in the north cascades the park contains an estimated acres km of old growth forests the biodiversity of the area is threatened by global climate change and invasive exotic plant species these exotic plants thrive by using man made structures such as roads and trails these invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed centaurea diffusa and reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea fauna edit the park also has a diversity of animal species including bald eagles golden eagles gray wolves coyotes bobcats canadian lynxes cougars moose elk river otters hoary marmots pika wolverines mountain goats grizzly bears and black bears the park is home to species of mammals and species of birds that either pass through or use the north cascades for a breeding area there are also species of fish on the west side of the cascades examples of amphibian species occurring in the park include the western toad bufo boreas and the rough skinned newt taricha granulosa fire edit climate edit air and water quality edit recreation edit mountaineering edit camping and hiking edit tourism edit attractions edit nearly all of the national park is protected as the stephen mather wilderness so there are few maintained buildings and roads within the north and south units of the park the park is most popular with backpackers and mountain climbers one of the most popular destinations in the park is cascade pass which was used as a travel route by native americans it can be accessed by a four mile km trail at the end of a gravel road the north and south picket ranges mount triumph as well as eldorado peak and the surrounding mountains are popular with climbers due to glaciation and technical rock mount shuksan in the northwest corner of the park is one of the most photographed mountains in the country and the second highest peak in the park ft or m access edit although a couple of gravel roads open to the public enter the park cascade river road beginning at marblemount off hwy and the upper stehekin valley road accessed from stehekin via tour boat from chelan most automobile traffic in the region travels on the north cascades highway washington state route which passes through the ross lake national recreation area the nearest large town on the west side of the park is sedro woolley washington while winthrop lies to the east chelan is located at the southeastern end of lake chelan where east side access to the ncnp from stehekin serves the eastern washington communities see also
