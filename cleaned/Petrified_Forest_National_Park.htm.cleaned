in navajo and apache counties in northeastern arizona named for its large deposits of petrified wood the fee area of the park covers about square miles square kilometers encompassing semi desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands the park s headquarters is about miles km east of holbrook along interstate i which parallels the bnsf railway s southern transcon the puerco river and historic u s route all crossing the park roughly east west the site the northern part of which extends into the painted desert was declared a national monument in and a national park in about people visit the park each year and take part in activities including sightseeing photography hiking and backpacking averaging about feet m in elevation the park has a dry windy climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about f c to winter lows well below freezing more than species of plants dominated by grasses such as bunchgrass blue grama and sacaton are found in the park fauna include larger animals such as pronghorns coyotes and bobcats many smaller animals such as deer mice snakes lizards seven kinds of amphibians and more than species of birds some of which are permanent residents and many of which are migratory about half of the park is designated wilderness the petrified forest is known for its fossils especially fallen trees that lived in the late triassic period about million years ago the sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful chinle formation from which the painted desert gets its name beginning about million years ago the colorado plateau of which the park is part was pushed upward by tectonic forces and exposed to increased erosion all of the park s rock layers above the chinle except geologically recent ones found in parts of the park have been removed by wind and water in addition to petrified logs fossils found in the park have included late triassic ferns cycads ginkgoes and many other plants as well as fauna including giant reptiles called phytosaurs large amphibians and early dinosaurs paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the park s fossils since the early th century the park s earliest human inhabitants arrived at least years ago by about years ago they were growing corn in the area and shortly thereafter building pit houses in what would become the park later inhabitants built above ground dwellings called pueblos although a changing climate caused the last of the park s pueblos to be abandoned by about ce more than archeological sites including petroglyphs have been discovered in the park in the th century spanish explorers visited the area and by the mid th century a u s team had surveyed an east west route through the area where the park is now located and noted the petrified wood later roads and a railway followed similar routes and gave rise to tourism and before the park was protected to large scale removal of fossils theft of

geography edit petrified forest national park straddles the border between apache county and navajo county in northeastern arizona the park is about miles km long from north to south and its width varies from a maximum of about miles km in the north to a minimum of about mile km along a narrow corridor between the north and south where the park widens again to about to miles to km i former u s route the bnsf railway and the puerco river bisect the park generally east west along a similar route adamana a ghost town is about mile km west of the park along the bnsf tracks holbrook about miles km west of park headquarters along i is the nearest city bisecting the park north south is park road which runs between i near park headquarters on the north and u s route on the south historic highway an earlier alignment of the modern route crosses the southern edge of the park like route it has deteriorated and is closed many unpaved maintenance roads closed to the public intersect park road at various points the fee area of the park covers about square miles km the navajo nation borders the park on the north and northeast state owned land federal land controlled by the bureau of land management and private land much of it used for cattle ranching adjoin the other borders the park s elevation above sea level varies from a low of feet m along the puerco river to a high of feet m at pilot rock the average elevation is about feet m the terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north most of the park s intermittent streams including lithodendron wash dead wash ninemile wash and dry wash empty into the puerco river in the southern part of the park cottonwood wash and jim camp wash flow into the little colorado river geology edit petrified forest national park is known for its fossils especially of fallen trees that lived in the late triassic period of the mesozoic era about million years ago during this period the region that is now the park was near the equator on the southwestern edge of the supercontinent pangaea and its climate was humid and sub tropical what later became northeastern arizona was a low plain flanked by mountains to the south and southeast and a sea to the west streams flowing across the plain from the highlands deposited inorganic sediment and organic matter including trees as well as other plants and animals that had entered or fallen into the water although most organic matter decays rapidly or is eaten by other organisms some is buried so quickly that it remains intact and may become fossilized within the park the sediments containing the fossil logs for which the park is named are part of the chinle formation painted desert badlands as seen from the rim at tawa point the colorful chinle which appears on the surface in many parts of the southwestern united states and from which the painted desert gets its name is up to feet m thick in the park it consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft fine grained mudstone siltstone and claystone much of which is bentonite as well as harder sandstone and conglomerate and limestone exposed to wind and water the chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs gullies mesas buttes and rounded hills its bentonite clay which swells when wet and shrinks while drying causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth lack of plant cover makes the chinle especially susceptible to weathering about million years ago tectonic movements of earth s crust began to uplift the colorado plateau of which the painted desert is part eventually parts of the plateau rose to feet m above sea level this warping of earth s surface led to the gradual and continuing destruction of the plateau by erosion an unconformity break in the rock record of about million years occurs within the park where erosion has removed all the rock layers above the chinle except geologically recent ones the bidahochi formation laid down only to million years ago rests directly atop the chinle and rocks laid down in the jurassic cretaceous and much of the tertiary are absent painted desert and petrified logs seen from blue mesa view of badlands in lower blue mesa trail during the period of the bidahochi deposition a large lake basin covered much of northeastern arizona the older lower layers of the formation consist of fluvial and lacustrine lake related deposits of silt sand and clay the younger upper bidahochi contains ash and lava from volcanoes that erupted nearby and as far away as southwestern nevada although much of the bidahochi has since eroded a small part of it outcrops in the northern part of the park on pilot rock in the park s wilderness section and along the rim of the painted desert between pintado and tawa points exposed by erosion of the bidahochi are volcanic landforms called maars flat bottomed roughly circular volcanic craters of explosive origin a maar vent can be seen from the pintado point lookout during the quaternary period million years ago up to today deposits of windblown sand and alluvium covered much of the chinle and bidahochi older dunes range in age from years at higher elevations in the northern part of the park to about years in sandy drainage areas such as lithodendron wash stabilized by grasses and other vegetation young dunes of about years old are found throughout the park fossils edit a petrified log in the petrified forest during the late triassic downed trees accumulating in river channels in what became the park were buried periodically by sediment containing volcanic ash groundwater dissolved silica silicon dioxide from the ash and carried it into the logs where it formed quartz crystals that gradually replaced the organic matter traces of iron oxide and other substances combined with the silica to create varied colors in the petrified wood in petrified forest national park most of the logs in the park retained their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure however a small fraction of the logs and most of the park s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral filled but still retain much of their original organic structure with these permineralized fossils it is possible to study the cellular make up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope other organic matter typically leaves seeds cones pollen grains spores small stems and fish insect and animal remains have been preserved in the park as compression fossils flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock much of the park s petrified wood is from araucarioxylon arizonicum trees while some found in the northern part of the park is from woodworthia arizonica and schilderia adamanica trees at least nine species of fossil trees from the park have been identified all are extinct the park has many other kinds of fossils besides trees the chinle considered one of the richest late triassic fossil plant deposits in the world contains more than fossil plant taxa plant groups represented in the park include lycopods ferns cycads conifers ginkgoes as well as unclassified forms the park has also produced many fossil vertebrates including giant crocodile like reptiles called phytosaurs large salamander like amphibians called buettneria and early dinosaurs and invertebrates including freshwater snails and clams climate edit colorful mineral detail inside a

been found inside the boundaries of petrified forest national park evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least years ago two folsom type spear points the earliest artifacts of paleo indians found in the park are at least that old between bce and ce the archaic early basketmaker era nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the petrified forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits pronghorn antelope and deer and harvested seeds from indian ricegrass and other wild plants around bce they began to grow corn in the area by ce as their farming techniques improved some built houses in the petrified forest and began to stay there year round the early farmers from the early basketmaker ii era lived in the petrified forest from about ce to about ce they occupied pit houses at fewer than sites at first on mesas or other vantage points and later at the base of bluffs and in lowlands where the soil was better as climatic conditions worsened for farming between and ce the settlements changed with the pueblo i era rather than below ground pits the pueblo builders constructed above ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year at the same time climatic conditions changed again this time for the better between and ce more than pueblo builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations at the mouths of washes near seeps and on moisture holding sand dunes petroglyphs pecked into desert varnish in petrified forest national park during the pueblo i era most sites were single family homes but as soils became exhausted many sites were abandoned by ce in favor of very large multi room pueblos close to more dependable sources of water the pueblo builders constructed two of these large pueblos one called stone axe about miles km east of the park and the other at puerco pueblo which overlooks the puerco river near the middle of the park there they built about one story rooms around an open plaza the rooms had no windows or doors but each could be entered by climbing a ladder and descending through a hole in the roof at its peak perhaps people lived in this pueblo over time however a persistently dry climate led to out migration and the last residents abandoned puerco pueblo in about ce at puerco pueblo and many other sites within the park petroglyphs images symbols or designs have been scratched pecked carved or incised on rock surfaces often on a patina known as desert varnish most of the petroglyphs in petrified forest national park are thought to be between and years old from the th through the th centuries explorers looking for routes between spanish colonies along the rio grande to the southeast and other spanish colonies on the pacific coast to the west passed near or through the area which they called el desierto pintado the painted desert however the park s oldest spanish inscriptions left by descendants of the region s early spanish colonists date only to the late th century u s edit lithodendron wash in the designated wilderness in the north part of the park amiel whipple surveyed along the wash in after the southwest became part of the u s explorers continued to look for good east west routes along the th parallel in a crew led by u s army lieutenant amiel whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the petrified forest so impressed was whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it lithodendron creek stone tree creek geologist jules marcou a member of the whipple expedition observed that the petrified trees were from the triassic a slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road built between and that involved experimental use of camels as transport in the late th century settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east west routes homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands and cattle grazed in the petrified forest until the mid th century also close to the th parallel was the atlantic and pacific railroad its opening in the early s led to the founding of towns like holbrook and adamana visitors could stop at the adamana train station book a hotel room and take a tour of what was then called the chalcedony forest over the years the line changed hands becoming the atchison topeka and santa fe railway and then the bnsf more than bnsf trains mostly carrying freight pass through the park every day u s route a former transcontinental auto highway developed in from part of the national old trails road ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in the park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road interstate which crosses the park replaced the older highway exhibit commemorating u s route a historic transcontinental highway that passed through the park increasing tourist and commercial interest in petrified wood during the late th century began to alarm residents of the region in the arizona territorial legislature asked the u s congress to create a petrified forest national park although this first attempt failed in the antiquities act signed by president theodore roosevelt was used to create the petrified forest national monument between and the federal civilian conservation corps built road trails and structures in the monument and the government acquired additional land in the painted desert section the monument became a national park in six years after the signing of the wilderness act in by president lyndon b johnson wilderness areas where human activity is limited were designated in the park in president george w bush signed a bill authorizing the eventual expansion of the park from acres about mi or km to acres about mi or km theft of petrified wood is still a problem despite a guard force of seven national park service rangers fences warning signs and the threat of a fine an estimated short tons kg of the fossil wood is stolen from the petrified forest every year jessee walter fewkes the first archeologist to visit puerco ruin predicted in the late th century that it would yield many artifacts conservationist john muir conducted the first excavations of the ruin in although he did not publish his findings he urged the federal government to preserve petrified forest professional archeological work in the park began in the early th century when walter hough conducted excavations at puerco ruin and other sites in a phytosaur skull was discovered near blue mesa in the petrified forest and sent to the museum of paleontology in berkeley california in annie alexander founder of the museum visited blue mesa to collect more of the phytosaur and other specimens this led to further excavations by paleontologist charles camp since then more than fossil sites have been documented in the park in the s the civil works administration funded research in the park by archeologists h p mera and c b cosgrove a national park service resurvey of the petrified forest in the early s identified most of the large sites with stone ruins and subsequent surveys since have identified a total of more than artifact sites many of them small research in paleontology and archeology continues at the park in the st century biology edit flora edit a survey found that species of flora of which species are invasive occur in the park although the park is known for its fossils and eroded badlands its main environment is semi desert shrub steppe protected from development and overgrazing for many years the park has some of the best grassland in northeastern arizona in the northern part of the park the volcanic soils of the bidahochi formation support abundant plant life along the painted desert rim in contrast to the relatively bare badlands below the rim is covered with shrubs small trees grasses and herbs at tiponi point lush vegetation on the painted desert rim overlooks the relatively barren badlands below the dominant plants in the park include more than grass species many native to the region growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose mariposa lily and blue flax and shrubs such as sagebrush saltbush and rabbitbrush among the wide variety of grasses are native perennial bunchgrass blue grama sacaton sideoats grama bearded sprangletop and bush muhly invasive species that crowd out slower spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome cheat grass trees and shrubs grow in riparian zones along the park s washes willows and cottonwoods are the larger plants joined by rushes and sedges here the invasive eurasian tamarisk also known as saltcedar threatens native plants by crowding using most of the available water and increasing soil salinity by exuding salt through its leaves fauna edit coyotes are omnivores with a widely varied diet including many rodents some of the larger animals roaming the grasslands include pronghorns black tailed jackrabbits hares gunnison s prairie dogs coyotes bobcats and foxes pronghorns the fastest land animals in north america are capable of mile per hour km h sprints the blood vessels in the huge thin walled ears of the jackrabbits act as heat exchangers these hares are known for their bursts of speed long leaps and zigzag routes all of which protect them from being eaten by golden eagles and other predators the prairie dogs live in large colonies or towns near which many other species find food and shelter coyotes dine largely on rodents but also eat fruits reptiles insects small mammals birds and carrion bobcats and bullsnakes hunt smaller animals such as deer mice and white tailed antelope squirrels in the park s riparian zones western pipistrelle bats feast on insects and pallid bats eat beetles centipedes cicadas praying mantises scorpions and other arthropods on the painted desert rim small animals find food and shelter among the denser foliage and mule deer sometimes frequent the area more than kinds of lizards and snakes live in various habitats in the park and consume large quantities of insects spiders scorpions other reptiles and small mammals the collared lizard which occurs in every habitat is the largest and most often seen the collared lizard is the largest lizard in the park plateau striped whiptails a species consisting entirely of females prefer grasslands and developed areas side blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen gopher snakes which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed are among the most common snakes in the park the western rattlesnake the only venomous snake found in the park prefers grasslands and shrub areas seven kinds of amphibians which drink no water but absorb it through their permeable skins have been identified in petrified forest national park tiger salamanders found in grassland and near major drainages are the only salamander species known in arizona woodhouse s toads which are seldom seen are the largest toads in the park they like grasslands riparian corridors and developed areas red spotted toads most active in the rainy season july through september are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons the great plains toad the most common toad in the park prefers grasslands resident spadefoot toads include the new mexico plains and couch s varieties western meadowlarks prized for their song frequent the park a survey conducted in identified species of birds known to have occurred in petrified forest national park since the park became a protected area in of those species breed within the park other species probably do and species live in the park year round thirty five species live in the park only during the summer and species only during the winter the greatest diversity of birds occurs during fall and winter migrations raptors songbirds and ground birds are found in the park s grassland while the puerco river s riparian corridor is a good place for year round residents as well as migrants such as warblers vireos avocets and killdeer developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers hermit warblers house finches and others occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park birds commonly seen in the park include the common raven and the western meadowlark known for its charming song anna s hummingbird which can hover and fly backwards as well as forwards is among the smallest birds in the park the largest is the golden eagle with a wingspan of up to feet m activities edit map of the park the park is open every day except christmas december on a schedule that varies slightly with the seasons in it and its painted desert visitor
