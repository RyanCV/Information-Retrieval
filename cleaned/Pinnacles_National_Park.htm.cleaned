body national park service pinnacles national park is a u s national park protecting a mountainous area located east of the salinas valley in central california about miles km east of soledad and miles km southeast of san jose the park s namesakes are the eroded leftovers of the western half of an extinct volcano that has moved miles km from its original location on the san andreas fault embedded in a portion of the california pacific coast ranges pinnacles is managed by the national park service and the majority of the park is protected as wilderness the national park is divided by the rock formations into east and west divisions connected by foot trails there is no through road that connects the east and west entrances to the park the east side has shade and water the west has high walls the rock formations provide for spectacular pinnacles that attract rock climbers the park features unusual talus caves that house at least thirteen species of bat pinnacles is most often visited in spring or fall because of the intense heat during the summer months park lands are prime habitat for prairie falcons and are a release site for california condors that have been hatched in captivity pinnacles national monument was established in by u s president theodore roosevelt pinnacles national park was created from the former pinnacles national monument by legislation passed by congress in late and signed into law by president barack obama on january contents history national monument national park status geography and climate geology ecology animals vegetation hain wilderness activities see also notes and references bibliography external links history edit native americans in the pinnacles region comprised the chalon and mutsun groups of the ohlone people who left stone artifacts in the park these native people declined with the arrival of the spanish in the th century who brought novel diseases and changes to the natives way of life the last chalon had died or departed from the area by from to when the first anglo american settlers arrived the pinnacles region was a wilderness without human use or habitation the establishment of a spanish mission at soledad hastened the area s native depopulation through disease and dispersion archaeological surveys have found thirteen sites inhabited by native americans twelve of which post date the establishment of the missions one site is believed to be about years old by the s the pinnacles then known as the palisades were visited by picnickers from the surrounding communities who would explore the caves and camp the first account of the pinnacles region appeared in print in describing the balconies area between and newspaper articles shifted from describing excursions to the palisades to calling them the pinnacles interest in the area rose to the point that the hollister free lance sent a reporter to the pinnacles followed two months later by a party of local officials investors came from san francisco to consider placing a resort hotel there but the speculation came to nothing in a post office was established in bear valley schuyler hain was the postmaster since there was at least one other bear valley in california the post office was named cook after mrs hain s maiden name in the post office was renamed pinnacles schuyler hain was a homesteader who arrived in the pinnacles area in from michigan following his parents and eight siblings to bear valley his cousin a w white was a student at stanford university and white brought one of his professors to see the pinnacles in dr gilbert was impressed by the scenery and his comments inspired hain to publicize the region hain led tours to bear valley and through the caves advocating the preservation of the pinnacles hain s efforts resulted in a visit by stanford president david starr jordan who contacted fresno congressman james c needham jordan and needham in turn influenced gifford pinchot to advocate the establishment of the pinnacles forest reserve to president theodore roosevelt roosevelt proclaimed the establishment on july pinchot who was primarily interested in the management of forests for productive use rather than for preservation advocated the use of the recently passed antiquities act to designate the scenic core of the area as pinnacles national monument which was done by roosevelt on january this designation nominally passed control of the pinnacles from the department of agriculture to the department of the interior but the u s forest service retained effective control of the area until circa in his efforts to promote the pinnacles hain became convinced that the pinnacles were an extraordinary mountain described by captain george vancouver and pictured by john sykes in his book voyage of discovery which documented the vancouver expedition hain began to refer to the mountain as vancouver s pinnacles a term that was picked up by sunset in a article references to vancouver s pinnacles persisted until when analysis of the sykes picture indicated that the mountain described by vancouver was actually located near fort ord within easy reach of the day trip described by vancouver national monument edit first set aside as part of the pinnacles forest reserve in pinnacles has had several different federal management agencies ranging from the u s forest service to the general land office and ultimately to the national park service in president theodore roosevelt created pinnacles national monument with the power given him in the antiquities act of the initial area designated under the antiquities act was acres ha the forest service relinquished control of the monument circa but no operating agency yet existed to receive it no drivable roads existed into the park from communities like hollister hollister boosters campaigned for federal funds for road building congressman everis a hayes made a trip into the pinnacles in as part of the campaign for road funds by primitive roads extended to bear valley the bear gulch reservoir at pinnacles the national park service was finally established in but pinnacles was not considered significant enough to command any park service resources at that time in the meantime a mining claim disrupted access to the traditional picnic grounds in following repeated pleas from local residents for park service action w b lewis superintendent of yosemite national park was directed to visit pinnacles and report on the circumstances to park service director stephen mather lewis had a difficult trip and stayed only minutes and his report included a recommendation that the monument be abandoned since the most scenic sections were in private hands the general land office which administered lands surrounding the national monument and what was then known as monterey national forest also received complaints and in december j h favorite of the glo made a thorough report which was copied to mather favorite recommended that public domain lands be consolidated into the monument and that a caretaker be appointed from a local homestead in herman hermansen was appointed caretaker and on may the monument was enlarged by proclamation of president warren g harding mather finally visited the monument on march a further proclamation this time by calvin coolidge enlarged the monument on july securing water sources and campsites was followed by a directive for a complete survey of the now acre ha monument following a visit by nps assistant director horace m albright money was appropriated to build a ranger s cabin completed in while facilities within the caves were improved frank a kittredge the park service chief of engineering and thomas chalmers vint park service landscape architect conducted a survey for a five year improvement plan in in condemnation proceedings were filed against private landowners in and around the park including the mining company seeking acres ha an expansion proclamation by president herbert hoover added acres ha in of land donated by san benito county trail building was expanded in the early s including a tunnel for the high peaks trail a view from the high peaks trail in a civilian conservation corps camp was established for about men who worked on additions to the trail network after lengthy legal proceedings the old mining claims were incorporated into the monument in ccc laborers improved the road in bear gulch built tourist cabins and constructed the dam at the bear gulch reservoir a fire lookout was built by the ccc on chalone peak in but was destroyed by fire in and replaced by a frame structure the following year the park s visitor center and headquarters were built in from local stone a superintendent s residence was started in and completed in the mission project added lands and new projects with an emphasis on development of the previously undeveloped west side of the park in the park comprised acres ha growing to the present acres ha through a series of additions including the acre ha pinnacles ranch the most recent addition to the pinnacles national monument was president bill clinton s proclamation that increased the size of the monument by acres km and to include more caves national park status edit legislation authored by rep sam farr d california to make pinnacles national monument a national park passed the united states senate on december having passed the house in june the bill also designates the present pinnacles wilderness as the hain wilderness in commemoration of schuyler hain s efforts to establish the national monument the legislation was signed by president barack obama on thursday january the change in designation does not change the park s status management or purpose congress specified in the general authorities act and the redwood act that all units of the national park system are to be treated on equal status regardless of title pinnacles is the ninth unit in the national park system in california to be named a national park geography and climate edit entrance to balconies cave at pinnacles national park pinnacles national park lies about miles km inland from

is located near the san andreas fault which had a hand in creating the unique formations the park protects the pinnacles are part of the neenach volcano which erupted million years ago near present day lancaster california the movement of the pacific plate along the san andreas fault split a section of rock off from the main body of the volcano and moved it miles km to the northwest it is believed that the pinnacles came from this particular volcano due to the unique breccias that are only found elsewhere in the neenach volcano formations differential erosion and weathering of the exposed rock created the pinnacles that are seen today the rock formations are andesite and rhyolite forming a dropped fault block embedded in the gabilan range large scale earth movement also created the talus caves that can be found in the park deep narrow gorges and shear fractures were transformed into caves by large chunks of rock falling from above and wedging into the cracks leaving an open area below since the pinnacles were moved to this area the san andreas fault has shifted miles km to the east of the park the original location of the san andreas can be seen in the chalone creek fault two other large faults are known to run through the park the miner s gulch and pinnacles faults these faults parallel the san andreas and were most likely caused by major movements of the main fault the establishment of the relative movement between the pinnacles and the neenach rocks was a significant factor in the acceptance of plate tectonics in geology seismic activity is frequent in the park and united states geological survey maintains two seismometers within the boundaries evidence of past and ongoing seismic activity can be seen in offset streams where they cross faults valley bottoms and terraces show signs of uplift ecology edit map of pinnacles national park also see resolution adjustable pdf map animals edit prairie falcons breed in this area in some of the highest densities of anywhere in north america peregrine falcons have recently returned to the park to breed also but in far fewer numbers a california condor re establishment program has been in place since the first nest since reintroduction was built in and pinnacles now manages a population of free flying condors bobcats cougars coyotes california quail wild turkey and many other birds and mammals live in the area formerly native animals now vanished from most of central california included tule elk and pronghorn antelope grizzly and black bears were in the area until the end of the th century like many parks in central california pinnacles has had a small problem with wild pigs a mix of feral domestic pigs and imported wild boars disturbing the landscape on a regular basis as of spring the core of the park was pig free the culmination of a twenty year million dollar effort had succeeded in eradicating pigs from the main area of the park national park service personnel along with iws worked to remove pigs from inside the park and establish and monitor an exclusionary pig fence that runs for approximately miles km around the center core of the park outside this fence however wild pigs still roam in regular abundance current monitoring for potential breaks and breaches in the fence is needed to ensure that the pigs do not return to devastate the park thirteen species of bats have been documented at pinnacles with a further three species considered likely the park s talus caves provide roosting and breeding habitat for the bats in the s a student biologist olivia messinger did a census of bees at pinnacles she found that the park has more bees per unit area than we know of anywhere else on earth around species most of these bees are solitary bees not living in colonies like european honeybees and most live for only three to four weeks and since flowers bloom here throughout the growing season there are many niches for all the bee species an interesting five minute video is found at sfnps org bees vegetation edit in the warmer portions of the park large areas of greasewood cover slopes along with manzanita gray pine canyon live oak and blue oak cooler portions of the park have higher proportions of pines and oaks together with california buckeye hollyleaf cherry and coffeeberry willows and elderberries are found along the intermittent streams fire has been a dominant influence on the region s flora both from natural causes and from intentional intervention by people when the region was inhabited by native americans they used fire as a tool to encourage the growth of preferred food sources and to herd small game during hunting since the disappearance of native peoples the hills have become brushier hain wilderness edit more than acres or hectares of the park is designated as the hain wilderness known until as the pinnacles wilderness wilderness designation provides even higher protection for the rock spires that give pinnacles its name as well as south chalone peak the second highest peak in the park the wilderness includes the creeks and canyons that are habitat for the endangered red legged frog the united states congress in enacted public law adding pinnacles wilderness and several others to the national wilderness preservation system activities edit a section of the high peaks trail although roads approach the park from the west through soledad and from the east through empty lands south of hollister the roads do not connect in the park most of the developed areas are on the east side of the park there are several trails for day hikers some of which are strenuous primarily in march and april a wide variety of wildflowers is on display except in years of extreme drought the trails provide views of the surrounding hills and valleys on clear days the san andreas fault is visible from some vantages along the trails the park includes a well known hiking portion known among enthusiasts simply as the pig fence this portion of south wilderness trail is a challenging stretch of strenuous hiking that at times requires use of the fence erected to prevent feral pigs from entering the park to help oneself to climb the steeply pitched trail other trails include lush wildflower accented views along flat stream beds trails that bring one into beautiful caves and trails that involve high vistas of the pinnacle formations the park is popular with advanced rock climbers due to the many difficult and challenging climbs the caves at pinnacles are talus caves formed when steep narrow canyons were filled with boulders leaving passages between the larger rocks the bear gulch on the east side of the park and balconies caves on the west side are seasonally open to visitors these caves house breeding colonies for townsend s big eared bat and are closed during pupping season the caves may be flooded at times of high water camping facilities are available on the east side in the pinnacles campground see also edit state
